(100, 'Charlie', 'cengiz.gur98@hotmail.com', '0422015709', 'Greetings,\r\n\r\nI am interested in getting a logo made for my new company. I have designed a draft independently to give an indication on what I would like to be designed. I am wondering if I could have the design I have attached made for me as close as possible how ever you are able to. I was interested in having both a black and white background, as well as a transparent one. I have given an indication of the two different backgrounds in the images attached. I will also provide the fonts used, if you are able to use the same fonts, that would be great, if not, a very similar one would be desired. The colours and tones only included in the logo are black, white and blues, the blue being as shown in the image.

I was on your website and noticed that professionals like you may benefit from having live chat operators on your website.\r\n\r\nAre you interested in outsourcing your website chat for just $149/month for unlimited chats 24 x 7 x 365 days?

You would get all the chat leads within minutes for further followup by your sales or customer service agents.\r\n\r\nYou could try our 15 days free trial with no commitment or pressure to buy, so you could see if enabling real human chat agents on your website would suit you.\r\n\r\nI would love to schedule a time to chat over the phone and show you how HelpDesk247 would benefit you.
