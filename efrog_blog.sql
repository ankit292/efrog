You can promote your brand with a small budget. The only thing you need to take care of that you deliver the exact thing to your customers what your brand claims. The marketing of your brand absolutely runs on emotions. So, keep your brand tone even and interactive while marketing your brand. For example, Starbucks built their brand with one single mission “Our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.” Unlike other brands, Starbucks focuses on the importance of building a community of happy and satisfied customers one step at a time.

If your business doesn’t have any USP, how you going to decide the tone and things while marketing your business. Let me make it more simple for you, When we see a logo of Mcdonald’s the very first thing comes in our mind is “Burgers”. You know why? Because that’s their USP, that makes them stand out from other fast-food chains. So, before marketing your business, you need to figure out what’s your or your business’s USP.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Branding is just a name and logo:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Logo, the name of your business is a part of your branding, but branding is much more than a name or a logo. Branding is all about the feelings, features, and emotions associated with your company. Let’s take the example of the “Liverpool Football Club”. We all are very well aware of LFC, the fans of LFC have an emotional attachment with it, that’s made the Liverpool Football club so popular among all the football fan across the world.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Customers only care about product / service:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Actually, customers care a lot about choosing a brand that appeals to them and are able to connect with. A stuntman or a fan of extreme sports are more likely to pick a Red Bull energy drink over, for example, a Monster. That’s because Red Bull promotes themselves among these groups of people. Or, imagine walking into a drugstore looking for toothpaste. Which one are you more likely to pick? The one you saw an advertisement of (it showed footage of smiling people with perfectly white teeth) or some other random paste you’ve never heard about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, obviously the first one! According to Malcolm Gladwell: “Buyers make most decisions by relying on their&nbsp;two-second first impressions based on stored memories, images and feelings” (Gladwell, The Power of Thinking Without Thinking) – that means, an advertisement you saw some time ago is now embedded in your brain and will impact your choices! No matter how good the other toothpaste is, or how bad the first one might be, you will most likely choose the one you are familiar with.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Branding will not make you any money:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s true, it won’t. The sales of your product or service will make you money. Consistent branding across all channels increases revenue by 23%.

The only thing you need to take care of that you deliver the exact thing to your customers what your brand claims. The marketing of your brand absolutely runs on emotions. So, keep your brand tone even and interactive while marketing your brand. For example, Starbucks built their brand with one single mission “Our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.” Unlike other brands, Starbucks focuses on the importance of building a community of happy and satisfied customers one step at a time.

Namely, integration of software applications in such a way that they use a shared database, integration using service-oriented architecture stacks (point to point direct integration and standalone enterprise service bus integration), robotic process automation and a combination of these approaches. We will learn about the challenges concerning SAP integration by discussing the merits and limitations of each of the 5 approaches below. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Shared database</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A number of software applications are integrated with an underlying shared database. All applications share and use the same data residing in that location. This ensures the data being used in different business processes is uniform as all changes to the data take instantaneous effect. The transmission of the data is relatively fast as it doesn’t have to cross lots of interfaces between the business process software application and the database.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Naturally, like all technology, these advantages of the centralized repository of data shared real-time with integrated software systems, come with some trade-offs:<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Higher risk of entire SAP ERP system failure: </strong>The complete suite of software systems connected to and dependent on the database can become inoperable due to any failure of the database.

These products are application servers, management and development tools, orchestration engines, etc. The SOA integration architecture is quite robust due to the fact that it’s integrated apps are coupled loosely and free to mature organically. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture\">SOA architecture</a> helps to bring costs down as it is easier to tend to stacked apps compared to maintaining each and every constituent application as a standalone. The reliability-factor of stacked apps is also higher than that of separate standalone programs. Once a stacked framework has been implemented, adding additional applications for supporting new business processes is not too expensive. SOA stacking allows businesses to create, consolidate and deploy services and add/modify them as required. It also allows the convenience of the rapid introduction of new services, easy modification of existing ones and compatibility to external systems. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Disadvantages of the SOA approach:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>The disadvantage of the SOA approach is that multiple products in the stack have to be configured and deployed. Since a stack usually has a large number of products within its framework, this can take time.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>SOA implementation takes a long time, at times years. This extends the initial implementation phase over a considerable period of time and hence drives up the initial implementation cost.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Also, developers working to build the stack framework have to have expertise in each of the proprietary software slated to be included in the stack. So recruitment of new developers will have to be given careful attention as it is mandatory that they have the specialist knowledge that went into creation, deployment, and maintenance of the stack so far.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>At the same time, significant initial investments, complicated configurations, and change management, demanding network and system monitoring make up the dark side of SOA solutions. </li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>SOA-based integration is of two types: point-to-point integration and enterprise service bus (ESB).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Point-to-point integration with SAP interfaces </strong>is complex, expensive and tedious. It isn\'t flexible as it forms rigid links; and is suited for the SAP environment only. Also, It is less suitable to a SAP environment that is constantly evolving. Business processes of an organization are bound to change constantly due to improvements and adjustments. The point-to-point integration architecture lacks additional touchpoints between the integrated systems and the resulting dependencies are unreliable. This isn’t an ideal long term investment. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This type of integration is beneficial when there are few services or systems to be integrated.

It primarily acts as a messenger between applications and components. It is able to maintain and manage traditional SOA stacks efficiently. ESBs come with their own management tools. They also integrate well with the management tools currently being used in the organization. They do not come laden with a heap of new technologies that have to be learned to work with them. They integrate well with the development tools and technologies already in use. Integration using ESB reduces upfront costs.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The disadvantage of the ESB approach is that like a shared database, there is a high dependency of every integrated software application on it. Any problems with the ESB will freeze up the entire ERP system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Robotic process automation (RPA)</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>AI robots do not need to be programmed but can mimic and learn repetitive user operations on the system frontend GUI.

A business runs its Instagram account to reach and grow an audience base and try to convert them into end-users of its products or services. This is more of a facility to prospect for customers, rather than share personal or private non-professional subject matter. Several businesses, however, choose deliberately to run personal accounts, and this is entirely up to the vision and philosophy of the business owners and decision-makers.

This will take some work as you would probably need a lot of time and work to figure out what works with both you and your target audience and what doesn’t. But once you do find “your look,” stick with it. Any Instagrammer will look at the profile photo first, and consciously or unconsciously form impressions.

Instagram has steadily risen through the ranks to dominate all social media platforms for B2C marketers. It is highly rewarding to market on Instagram as it is mobile-based and thus enjoys recognition as one of the platforms with the <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/?locale=en_AU\">highest user engagement</a>. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instagram isn’t just viable for the B2C model but offers a TON of value to B2B models too.

Instagram features like Stories, linking a website to the profile section or sharing User Generated Content help to connect and engage with other businesses. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The best way to harness Instagram’s power is by getting in the thick of things - use the 15 tips below to increase your social selling success!<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Create a Business Account </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One normally uses a personal account on any social platform as a way of sharing aspects of his life with his friends and family. But a Business account is run with a very different objective in mind. A business runs its Instagram account to reach and grow an audience base and try to convert them into end-users of its products or services. This is more of a facility to prospect for customers, rather than share personal or private non-professional subject matter. Several businesses, however, choose deliberately to run personal accounts, and this is entirely up to the vision and philosophy of the business owners and decision-makers. But remember your reaction to a very personal and private post of any specific individual on a business page you happened to visit in the past. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Business profiles have the gist of extensive analytics data that can easily be obtained by the addition of important contact information to the “Bio.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Maintain consistency of Profile Name and Picture </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Consistency of any profile imagery is vital across your social media platforms. Consistency helps to build and maintain brand reputation. Try to use the same profile picture everywhere! This will take some work as you would probably need a lot of time and work to figure out what works with both you and your target audience and what doesn’t. But once you do find “your look,” stick with it. Any Instagrammer will look at the profile photo first, and consciously or unconsciously form impressions. If they continually encounter the same image across all social media platforms, they’ll have an easier time remembering your brand with the content they happen to be consuming at that point in time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Create an attractive and arresting Profile </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most likely your services involve myriad workflows and creating value across multiple channels for your consumers.

The idea is that Instagram should represent your organization as a vibrant and happening brand. Anything is better than a bland, uninteresting and boring stock image.

Instagram has steadily risen through the ranks to dominate all social media platforms for B2C marketers.

But a Business account is run with a very different objective in mind. A business runs its Instagram account to reach and grow an audience base and try to convert them into end-users of its products or services. This is more of a facility to prospect for customers, rather than share personal or private non-professional subject matter. Several businesses, however, choose deliberately to run personal accounts, and this is entirely up to the vision and philosophy of the business owners and decision-makers.

Consistency helps to build and maintain brand reputation. Try to use the same profile picture everywhere! This will take some work as you would probably need a lot of time and work to figure out what works with both you and your target audience and what doesn’t. But once you do find “your look,” stick with it. Any Instagrammer will look at the profile photo first, and consciously or unconsciously form impressions. If they continually encounter the same image across all social media platforms, they’ll have an easier time remembering your brand with the content they happen to be consuming at that point in time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Create an attractive and arresting Profile </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most likely your services involve myriad workflows and creating value across multiple channels for your consumers.

Please, take the initiative of updating it as frequently as required. There are many more innovative uses for this link than just linking it to the brand website. Why not use the link to help users teleport digitally to content and app download sources? Or whisking your customers away to purchase your products without having to perform lengthy searches or navigation? Or take them where they can quick-register for events? Sounds good?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Repurpose old Content with a Purpose! </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> This is an efficient and tactical marketing move if there ever was one! Don’t let your existing blog posts, ebooks, videos, and webinars become redundant without extracting every possible bit of value from them. Repurpose bits and purposes of all this old content to create newer and appealing content your target audience will happily consume! Did you know that you can make an existing picture appear as new content just by snipping off a relevant portion after zooming in on it? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Focus on revealing “Behind-The-Scenes” <br></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As consumers, all human beings are very curious about the production process and assembly of the products they find interesting.

The idea is that Instagram should represent your organization as a vibrant and happening brand. Anything is better than a bland, uninteresting and boring stock image. The idea is to arrest eyeballs, capture interest and provoke thoughts through an image that speaks, rather than place a drab and uninviting visual as your online identity on this platform. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Use the Stories feature </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Build continuous and long-lasting market impression with Stories and Videos. Instagram throws open the doors of business space to the world to give a rare peek into the inner philosophy or “mantra” of a company. Trust us, everyone is tired of the routine ads with stock footage and larger-than-life, unrealistic and unrelatable shots associated with pushy, in-your-face advertising. Use videos and the storytelling facility on Insta to give your business a rare opportunity -  to appear human and relatable instead of staying a faceless brand with no personality or social connections. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you need inspiration with this approach we’re discussing, see if this helps - incorporate visuals that clearly show the entire product lifecycle of your brand.

This is more of a facility to prospect for customers, rather than share personal or private non-professional subject matter. Several businesses, however, choose deliberately to run personal accounts, and this is entirely up to the vision and philosophy of the business owners and decision-makers.

It makes sense to make use of its mammoth user base for building and promoting your brand. Let us learn how to increase Facebook traffic, to and from your business website. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Rely on yourself instead of algorithms</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is common knowledge that whenever there is a change in the algorithms of the internet dominators (Google, Facebook, Insta, et al), there is a direct effect on one’s brand website traffic. So instead of depending on algorithms that are bound to change it’s better to just market differently on these platforms.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Facebook Messenger, unlike Facebook’s wall or page, allows linking to websites without scrutiny by the algorithm. Like text messaging or sending emails, using Facebook Messenger to increase Facebook traffic to your business website takes some work. The good news is it isn\'t difficult. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The popularity of messaging apps is overtaking social media platforms. According to these <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/facebook-traffic-messenger/\">statistics</a>, users are more inclined to open messenger chats and click through to business website pages using the links inside the chats than through traditional marketing emails. And the best thing about marketing on Facebook Messenger is that you need not focus on selling or conversion. It’s just plain and simple engagement with the user by having a simple and friendly conversation. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>Neil Patel, in his <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/facebook-traffic-messenger/\">blog</a>, has discussed some useful tactics to use Facebook Messenger to increase Facebook traffic to your business website. All the tactics shown below are aimed at increasing the number of contacts on a Messenger List. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Install a Facebook Messenger Chatbot on your business website</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":123} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Increase-Facebook-Traffic-of-Your-Business-Website-By-Doing-This-01.jpg\" alt=\"Increase Facebook Traffic of Your Business Website By Doing This-01\" class=\"wp-image-123\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Incoming website traffic become messenger contacts. Most people are already logged into their Facebook Messengers. Instead of reading lots of text, they like clicking on the Messenger Widget to get their questions answered. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MobileMonkey and WP-Chatbot help you make your own friendly chatbot on your business website in just a few minutes. They are much more appealing and useful to everyone than the traditional contact form on the “Contact Us” page of many websites. It beats having to wait for a response when one can get instant attention in a more friendly and personalized format in the form of an artificially-intelligent machine-learning chatbot.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Add Messenger Contacts from existing Email Subscribers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The rationale behind this tactic is converting existing contacts into more effective marketing channels. This is easily done by using a chatbot builder to create links within emails to invitation links where users can opt in to updates.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The list of places that can host a link is only limited by a marketer’s imagination. Some of them are CTAs in blogs, email signatures, and landing pages.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Turn existing Facebook fans into Messenger contacts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":125} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Increase-Facebook-Traffic-of-Your-Business-Website-By-Doing-This-02.jpg\" alt=\"Increase Facebook Traffic of Your Business Website By Doing This-02\" class=\"wp-image-125\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A brand’s existing Facebook page fans are easily encouraged to increase the level of interaction since they already know and trust the brand. When there is already a Facebook page that obviously took some work to gain a sizeable fan following, it makes sense to turn these fans into Messenger Contacts. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The CTA on the Facebook page can be repurposed from simply asking fans to get more information on the business website. Instead of “Find out more” or “Get Details” the CTA can ask fans to “Send Message,” thereby turning them into Messenger contacts via instant participation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Use Post-Autoresponder Bots</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a powerful tactic to convert commenters on a Facebook post into a Messenger Contact. This is done by getting a chatbot to respond immediately after a user finishes commenting on a post. The replying user gets added to the contact list instantly. So all the hard work that was initially put into making an intelligent and value-adding post to build and maintain an organic fan following doesn’t go to waste. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Getting fans to engage in quizzes and polls and rewarding them with coupon codes in the auto-response is a great way to drive engagement in a ready-made fanbase and convert them into Messenger Contacts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Run a Paid Ad</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":126} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Increase-Facebook-Traffic-of-Your-Business-Website-By-Doing-This-3.jpg\" alt=\"Increase Facebook Traffic of Your Business Website By Doing This-03\" class=\"wp-image-126\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is for those who don\'t want to leave any stone unturned in building a large Messenger&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Contact base. Growing organic reach and utilizing them ineffective marketing channels are very good approaches, but working on them takes effort and time. There is a Facebook ad format that allows the user clicking on the ad to send a message to the advertiser. This automatically turns that user into a Messenger Contact. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Normally you’d think of a Facebook ad working hard to justify the money you’ve spent on it by taking users to your brand website. Then, it’s up to the brand website to handle the user and try a successful conversion. There is always the chance of users bouncing due to the lack of interactivity on the business website.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using an autoresponder in conjunction with the Facebook paid ad engages a user and reduces the risk of bounce through instant interaction. The autoresponder ad, something that runs in tandem with a Facebook ad can be built with ease on any good chatbot building platform.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have focussed on the Messenger feature as a marketing channel as it allows more engagement. But just so we are clear on the basics, a quick word on building the organic reach and maintaining it shouldn\'t be out of place. Especially because a lot of people do look up a business on Facebook before they look it up on Google. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since a Facebook presence is necessary, a business should treat its facebook page with as much importance as it does its own website. This means accurate and complete contact details of the organization and key leadership, proper logos and cover images from the company’s branding, and a website link.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The business also must consistently post on its Facebook page.

A localized website is a specialist in conveying a special kind of information that cannot be achieved with mere machine translation. Unlike a generic stock brand webpage, the localized website is especially suited for meeting a customer’s needs, be it cultural, currency-based, language-based or the desire for products or services with a personal touch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To help your brand website emote and communicate like a native and appear inviting and pleasant to a local populace, we have uncovered the following 5 secrets to successfully localized websites:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Identifying a Target Market </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":149} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-149\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first logical step is deciding in which country to market a brand’s products and services. The following questions help to shape this decision:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Is the country interested in the product?</li><li>Will the targeted consumer willingly choose the brand?</li><li>Can the business survive the already existing competition?</li><li>Is the brand’s product or service affordable to the targeted consumer?</li><li>Does that country’s market promise a healthy growth rate?</li><li>Are product delivery costs in the country manageable?</li><li>Is Customer Support in the local tongue affordable for the business?</li><li>Will the ROI justify the investment in website localization?</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The sensible thing to do is to first enter a market where there is the highest probability of the product getting sold. As costs can increase with multiple target countries and languages, it is better to start small and go with the flow until the brand finds new emerging markets.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the brand’s product is a bestseller in one particular region, it should be treated like a benchmark around which the rest of the business plan can be figured out.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The objective is to reach the highest number of potential customers without crossing the budget. After the marketing and financial indicators mentioned above have been studied, a business should consider the experiences of others regarding specific markets and learn from that as well. For example - the stories of Nike and Mercedes-Benz in China clearly prove that the cultural appropriateness of a product and its marketing technique are MORE IMPORTANT than plain statistics. China has a MASSIVE customer base (a misleading statistic from a business perspective) that is mostly untapped. This is because the localized websites operating here till date had been initially forced to explore the market without rock-solid guidance or expertise in Chinese culture and linguistics. Let\'s see what happened.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Nike</strong>: They designed white sneakers for The Year of the Monkey. The Chinese character on the left shoe, Fa (發), supposedly means good fortune. The character on the right shoe, Fu (福), is believed to denote wealth. Nike understandably thought that they have invented an excellent marketing gimmick. Despite their sincere efforts, this gimmick bombed. What they failed to grasp is that Chinese characters change in meaning when used in combination. So when the wearer of the sneakers joined heels, the resulting message, instead of “good fortune and wealth,” read “fat!”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong>: This company chose the phonetically-similar name “Ben-Si” (奔死), instead of “Benz,” to penetrate the Chinese market. But when they unwittingly implemented this decision, the two characters “Ben” and “Si,” when combined, advertized to Chinese consumers a brand name “run to death!”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Moral</strong>: Every market or country has its own quirks and unique qualities that have to be looked into so that disasters like the ones mentioned here can be avoided.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Build your Business from Scratch Around a Localized Website</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As of <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/\">October 2019</a>, 58% of earth’s population is now online. That amounts to a staggering 4.48 billion users worldwide; with China, India and the United States leading the way. While this huge number may not be an established consumer base for a particular brand, it certainly is a market filled with potential that shouldn\'t be left unutilized. So obviously if a business ignores this global market and instead confines itself to a single country or continent, it is missing out. Which is why in this day and age, building (and growing) a business and localizing the business website for a number of regions go hand-in-hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another interesting business insight is that consumer behaviour across the globe is now following similar trends, if not&nbsp; the same trend. Unlike earlier, if a product is successful in one particular geography there isn’t any reason why it shouldn’t do well in another. <strong>Important</strong>: While the demand for a particular product can be felt in the same strong way the world over, no one has said that it needs to be marketed in the same way everywhere.&nbsp; Hence the need to communicate in the local language. Hence the need for localized websites!<br><strong>Let’s drop yet another significant fact</strong>: English remains to be the most widespread and most used language, but other languages, particularly Chinese, are catching up. 72.4% of global shoppers prefer to use their native language when shopping online. 55% of global shoppers only buy products from websites that give information in their native language. 56.2% of the world’s consumers find the ability to obtain information in their own language to be more important than price. These <a href=\"http://www.oneskyapp.com/blog/14-compelling-statistics-about-the-importance-of-localization/\">facts and figures</a> clearly show the need for a localized website. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Keeping Design Flexible</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":150} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The average word length of the English language is 4.7 characters. Languages like German and Mongolian have average word lengths between 11.5 and 12. The distribution of <a href=\"http://www.ravi.io/language-word-lengths\">word lengths</a> in various languages is vastly varied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we apply this fact to a practical context, like trying to squeeze the German text “in den Warenkorb legen” on a button that originally read “Add to Cart” in English, we can appreciate the importance of this fact.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arabic text has a right-to-left reading direction. Chinese, Japanese and Korean texts are written and read vertically.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Therefore, keeping all these variances in mind, it makes sense to keep the website design flexible and leave at least 20% extra space within menus and buttons. A cluttered layout and hard-coded CTA URLs lead to broken design, string collapse, haphazard navigation and slow speed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So giving a website plenty of breathing space is the best way to insure it against different internet speeds in different regions. Keeping a website light by minimizing the amount of visual imagery helps it run faster. Also, keeping the quantity of images under control makes tailoring and localizing it a lot less time-consuming.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> “Internationalizing” a Website by using Unicode</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A total of 110–116 different characters exist across the different languages of the world. It is a happy thought that a website doesn\'t necessarily need to display each and every one of them. But a point to consider is that some or many of them may end up as strange symbols instead of being displayed correctly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unicode is used to counter this problem. The UTF-8 encoding format is reliable for handling most compatibility issues. UTF-16 is better suited for Chinese, Japanese and Devanagari.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Developers divide source codes and separate translatable strings so that translators can help them to adapt all the existing website data to the new language. Content is separated from the code and stored so that future website localization operations don’t require a repeat of breaking strings. Local preferences like the formats of mail addresses, data and time, numbers, calendars, currency, shipping address, etc have to have codes enabled. This functionality helps users make decisions on buying products and services without having to work out the math. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Local Keyword Research</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":151} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-151\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Google Search doesn’t enjoy a presence in each and every nation on earth. Freshly localized websites need to feature in the results page of native search engines. Baidu is the most popular search engine in China. Yandex is the most popular search engine in Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The keywords that are required to do this cannot be merely translated. A&nbsp; local SEO specialist is required to identify the right terms that the translator can include on the website immediately. Backlink creation is also something that needs to be done from scratch. A list of keywords needs to be drawn up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Translators then check the list for on-page and off-page applicability. They check metadata, the keyword density on the website and external link anchors.<br><strong>Important</strong>: a localized website isn’t just for markets differentiated by language. It has been observed that some nations that speak the same language like the UK and the USA, Mexico and Argentina, etc don\'t speak the common language in the same way. To make sure that a business website has a good position on the SERP, some solid keyword research is required to make sure that everyone involved in the business fully understands the differences in vocabulary between <a href=\"https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/six-difference-between-britsh-and-american-english/3063743.html\">two countries divided by a common language</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Apart from Language Translation...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> In addition to linguistic translation efforts; images, messages, and even colors have to be localised for a target audience. For example, Australia doesn’t play in the snow in December. Also, any user, anywhere any the world, unconsciously responds better to imagery that contains the same ethnicity as the target market. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Attention to Local Law and Regulations</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Every nation has different laws and regulations concerning terms of service, privacy, data protection, etc. For example, GDPR does not apply as harshly or strictly elsewhere in the world as it does within the EU, unless specifically mandated by the European Parliament or Union or by a country like Australia that has an overlap of the GDPR with its own Privacy Principles. To wade through these legal waters, the services of a local legal specialist is NOT an extravagance. Rather, one should think about how the cost is a lot LESS than any legal fee incurred on violating local law. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Localized Social Media Strategy</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Some quick facts</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Norway and Australia are the only two countries where <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-social-network-users-2019\">Snapchat</a> is more popular than Instagram.&nbsp;</li><li>India has 270 million Facebook users. Next comes the US, with 190. Third place is taken by Indonesia with 130 million. Facebook is banned in Bangladesh, China, Iran and North Korea.&nbsp;</li><li>Twitter is banned in China, Iran and North Korea. The US is the top twitter base at 47 million users. Japan comes next at 38.6 million. The UK comes third with 13.6 million.&nbsp;</li><li>China leads in LinkedIn use with 40.6 million users. Brazil is next with 32.6 million. The UK is third at 22.7 million. LinkedIn is blocked in Russia.</li><li>China, Iran and Korea have blocked Instagram completely. The US has the biggest number of Instagram users, 110 million. Brazil is at second place with 57 million and Indonesia comes next at 53 million.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Clearly, the right platform has to be used when building reach and engaging consumers. The localised website should display the right social sharing buttons.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Excellent Bonding and Cohesion in the Team</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Localization is hard is because there are a lot of people involved.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A successful business needs people on board who understand what makes the market tick. This includes translators, preferably native. They should be good at transcreation. Developers should be able to work well and collaborate with translators. The nature of the undertaking of localizing a website is such that the team is likely to be distributed across different time zones and geographies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Localized Customer Support</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Customers appreciate support in their native language. A business should provide its consumers with local phone numbers and addresses if it can. It makes the business appear more reliable, trustworthy and approachable to its customers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Customer Support should be trained and prepared to handle inquiries in local languages. In case hiring native speaking staff exceeds the budget, templates in all languages that answer common questions should be made visible and available.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Convenient Payment Options</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":152} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a critical parameter. Getting a bunch of new customers to the checkout page takes quite some work. Losing them at this point is VERY disappointing. If a willing consumer doesn’t find preferred payment options, It’ll take nothing for him to just&nbsp; click out of his browser and just forget about the whole thing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To make sure that isn\'t the case ever, here’s a handy list of <a href=\"https://addons.prestashop.com/en/content/35-the-most-popular-online-payment-methods-by-country\">payment options by country</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Translation Management Software</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Manually localizing a website is legitimately one of the worst things a human being can do to himself. Spreadsheets and emails have a margin of error that is just too high.&nbsp;<br>The right translation management tool allows translators to type directly onto the website. Use this convenient <a href=\"http://capterra.com/translation-management-software/\">list</a> to find a software package that can let your project management, developers and translators localize your brand website with ease. It is better to invest in a software than to try to save money in this area and end up in spreadsheet and word hell.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Testing Before Launch</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Particular areas to pay attention to are how fast or how slow the website is loading at the user’s end so that the first impression on a new audience is not abysmal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Testing and improvement should continue after the website is up and running. The business should necessarily request for feedback through surveys. This will increase the conversion rate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Linguistic testing should check that every word appearing on the website is correctly translated, accurate and 100% understood by the intended audience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Localization testing should check encryption algorithms, hardware compatibility, units of measurement, names, date, time, entry fields, links, etc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>All images should be appropriate.</li><li>The website should load correctly on all kinds of mobile devices and browsers.</li><li>Images shouldn’t take time to load and videos shouldn’t buffer or struggle to start.</li><li>Programmers must be made to streamline the HTML, remove unnecessary CSS and optimize the JavaScript.&nbsp;</li><li>A Content Delivery Network, or CDN helps by using local servers to speed up the loading of a website.</li><li>QA should be split out over regions and made to go through all site forms to check their function and look for broken design.</li><li>If the website is burdened with too much image and video, site speed will be slower than what a user might be willing to tolerate. It is better to shave off imagery and visualisations that you think are important than have 40% of potential consumers leave the website after waiting for more than three seconds for it to load.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Just Keep Calm and Do Your Best</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Website localization certainly seems daunting.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But our curation of best practices should get you through it.

A localized website is a specialist in conveying a special kind of information that cannot be achieved with mere machine translation. Unlike a generic stock brand webpage, the localized website is especially suited for meeting a customer’s needs, be it cultural, currency-based, language-based or the desire for products or services with a personal touch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To help your brand website emote and communicate like a native and appear inviting and pleasant to a local populace, we have uncovered the following 5 secrets to successfully localized websites:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Identifying a Target Market </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":149} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-149\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first logical step is deciding in which country to market a brand’s products and services. The following questions help to shape this decision: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Is the country interested in the product?</li><li>Will the targeted consumer willingly choose the brand?</li><li>Can the business survive the already existing competition?</li><li>Is the brand’s product or service affordable to the targeted consumer?</li><li>Does that country’s market promise a healthy growth rate?</li><li>Are product delivery costs in the country manageable?</li><li>Is Customer Support in the local tongue affordable for the business?</li><li>Will the ROI justify the investment in website localization?</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The sensible thing to do is to first enter a market where there is the highest probability of the product getting sold. As costs can increase with multiple target countries and languages, it is better to start small and go with the flow until the brand finds new emerging markets.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the brand’s product is a bestseller in one particular region, it should be treated like a benchmark around which the rest of the business plan can be figured out. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The objective is to reach the highest number of potential customers without crossing the budget. After the marketing and financial indicators mentioned above have been studied, a business should consider the experiences of others regarding specific markets and learn from that as well. For example - the stories of Nike and Mercedes-Benz in China clearly prove that the cultural appropriateness of a product and its marketing technique are MORE IMPORTANT than plain statistics. China has a MASSIVE customer base (a misleading statistic from a business perspective) that is mostly untapped. This is because the localized websites operating here till date had been initially forced to explore the market without rock-solid guidance or expertise in Chinese culture and linguistics. Let\'s see what happened.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Nike</strong>: They designed white sneakers for The Year of the Monkey. The Chinese character on the left shoe, Fa (發), supposedly means good fortune. The character on the right shoe, Fu (福), is believed to denote wealth. Nike understandably thought that they have invented an excellent marketing gimmick. Despite their sincere efforts, this gimmick bombed. What they failed to grasp is that Chinese characters change in meaning when used in combination. So when the wearer of the sneakers joined heels, the resulting message, instead of “good fortune and wealth,” read “fat!”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong>: This company chose the phonetically-similar name “Ben-Si” (奔死), instead of “Benz,” to penetrate the Chinese market. But when they unwittingly implemented this decision, the two characters “Ben” and “Si,” when combined, advertized to Chinese consumers a brand name “run to death!”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Moral</strong>: Every market or country has its own quirks and unique qualities that have to be looked into so that disasters like the ones mentioned here can be avoided.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Build your Business from Scratch Around a Localized Website</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As of <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/\">October 2019</a>, 58% of earth’s population is now online. That amounts to a staggering 4.48 billion users worldwide; with China, India and the United States leading the way. While this huge number may not be an established consumer base for a particular brand, it certainly is a market filled with potential that shouldn\'t be left unutilized. So obviously if a business ignores this global market and instead confines itself to a single country or continent, it is missing out. Which is why in this day and age, building (and growing) a business and localizing the business website for a number of regions go hand-in-hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another interesting business insight is that consumer behaviour across the globe is now following similar trends, if not  the same trend. Unlike earlier, if a product is successful in one particular geography there isn’t any reason why it shouldn’t do well in another. <strong>Important</strong>: While the demand for a particular product can be felt in the same strong way the world over, no one has said that it needs to be marketed in the same way everywhere.  Hence the need to communicate in the local language. Hence the need for localized websites!<br><strong>Let’s drop yet another significant fact</strong>: English remains to be the most widespread and most used language, but other languages, particularly Chinese, are catching up. 72.4% of global shoppers prefer to use their native language when shopping online. 55% of global shoppers only buy products from websites that give information in their native language. 56.2% of the world’s consumers find the ability to obtain information in their own language to be more important than price. These <a href=\"http://www.oneskyapp.com/blog/14-compelling-statistics-about-the-importance-of-localization/\">facts and figures</a> clearly show the need for a localized website. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Keeping Design Flexible</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":150} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The average word length of the English language is 4.7 characters. Languages like German and Mongolian have average word lengths between 11.5 and 12. The distribution of <a href=\"http://www.ravi.io/language-word-lengths\">word lengths</a> in various languages is vastly varied.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we apply this fact to a practical context, like trying to squeeze the German text “in den Warenkorb legen” on a button that originally read “Add to Cart” in English, we can appreciate the importance of this fact. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arabic text has a right-to-left reading direction. Chinese, Japanese and Korean texts are written and read vertically.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Therefore, keeping all these variances in mind, it makes sense to keep the website design flexible and leave at least 20% extra space within menus and buttons. A cluttered layout and hard-coded CTA URLs lead to broken design, string collapse, haphazard navigation and slow speed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So giving a website plenty of breathing space is the best way to insure it against different internet speeds in different regions. Keeping a website light by minimizing the amount of visual imagery helps it run faster. Also, keeping the quantity of images under control makes tailoring and localizing it a lot less time-consuming.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> “Internationalizing” a Website by using Unicode</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A total of 110–116 different characters exist across the different languages of the world. It is a happy thought that a website doesn\'t necessarily need to display each and every one of them. But a point to consider is that some or many of them may end up as strange symbols instead of being displayed correctly. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unicode is used to counter this problem. The UTF-8 encoding format is reliable for handling most compatibility issues. UTF-16 is better suited for Chinese, Japanese and Devanagari.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Developers divide source codes and separate translatable strings so that translators can help them to adapt all the existing website data to the new language. Content is separated from the code and stored so that future website localization operations don’t require a repeat of breaking strings. Local preferences like the formats of mail addresses, data and time, numbers, calendars, currency, shipping address, etc have to have codes enabled. This functionality helps users make decisions on buying products and services without having to work out the math. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Local Keyword Research</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":151} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-151\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Google Search doesn’t enjoy a presence in each and every nation on earth. Freshly localized websites need to feature in the results page of native search engines. Baidu is the most popular search engine in China. Yandex is the most popular search engine in Russia. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The keywords that are required to do this cannot be merely translated. A  local SEO specialist is required to identify the right terms that the translator can include on the website immediately. Backlink creation is also something that needs to be done from scratch. A list of keywords needs to be drawn up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Translators then check the list for on-page and off-page applicability. They check metadata, the keyword density on the website and external link anchors.<br><strong>Important</strong>: a localized website isn’t just for markets differentiated by language. It has been observed that some nations that speak the same language like the UK and the USA, Mexico and Argentina, etc don\'t speak the common language in the same way. To make sure that a business website has a good position on the SERP, some solid keyword research is required to make sure that everyone involved in the business fully understands the differences in vocabulary between <a href=\"https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/six-difference-between-britsh-and-american-english/3063743.html\">two countries divided by a common language</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Apart from Language Translation...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> In addition to linguistic translation efforts; images, messages, and even colors have to be localised for a target audience. For example, Australia doesn’t play in the snow in December. Also, any user, anywhere any the world, unconsciously responds better to imagery that contains the same ethnicity as the target market. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Attention to Local Law and Regulations</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Every nation has different laws and regulations concerning terms of service, privacy, data protection, etc. For example, GDPR does not apply as harshly or strictly elsewhere in the world as it does within the EU, unless specifically mandated by the European Parliament or Union or by a country like Australia that has an overlap of the GDPR with its own Privacy Principles. To wade through these legal waters, the services of a local legal specialist is NOT an extravagance. Rather, one should think about how the cost is a lot LESS than any legal fee incurred on violating local law. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Localized Social Media Strategy</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Some quick facts</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Norway and Australia are the only two countries where <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-social-network-users-2019\">Snapchat</a> is more popular than Instagram.&nbsp;</li><li>India has 270 million Facebook users. Next comes the US, with 190. Third place is taken by Indonesia with 130 million. Facebook is banned in Bangladesh, China, Iran and North Korea.&nbsp;</li><li>Twitter is banned in China, Iran and North Korea. The US is the top twitter base at 47 million users. Japan comes next at 38.6 million. The UK comes third with 13.6 million.&nbsp;</li><li>China leads in LinkedIn use with 40.6 million users. Brazil is next with 32.6 million. The UK is third at 22.7 million. LinkedIn is blocked in Russia.</li><li>China, Iran and Korea have blocked Instagram completely. The US has the biggest number of Instagram users, 110 million. Brazil is at second place with 57 million and Indonesia comes next at 53 million.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Clearly, the right platform has to be used when building reach and engaging consumers. The localised website should display the right social sharing buttons.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Excellent Bonding and Cohesion in the Team</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Localization is hard is because there are a lot of people involved. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A successful business needs people on board who understand what makes the market tick. This includes translators, preferably native. They should be good at transcreation. Developers should be able to work well and collaborate with translators. The nature of the undertaking of localizing a website is such that the team is likely to be distributed across different time zones and geographies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Localized Customer Support</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Customers appreciate support in their native language. A business should provide its consumers with local phone numbers and addresses if it can. It makes the business appear more reliable, trustworthy and approachable to its customers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Customer Support should be trained and prepared to handle inquiries in local languages. In case hiring native speaking staff exceeds the budget, templates in all languages that answer common questions should be made visible and available.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Convenient Payment Options</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":152} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a critical parameter. Getting a bunch of new customers to the checkout page takes quite some work. Losing them at this point is VERY disappointing. If a willing consumer doesn’t find preferred payment options, It’ll take nothing for him to just  click out of his browser and just forget about the whole thing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To make sure that isn\'t the case ever, here’s a handy list of <a href=\"https://addons.prestashop.com/en/content/35-the-most-popular-online-payment-methods-by-country\">payment options by country</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Translation Management Software</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Manually localizing a website is legitimately one of the worst things a human being can do to himself. Spreadsheets and emails have a margin of error that is just too high. <br>The right translation management tool allows translators to type directly onto the website. Use this convenient <a href=\"http://capterra.com/translation-management-software/\">list</a> to find a software package that can let your project management, developers and translators localize your brand website with ease. It is better to invest in a software than to try to save money in this area and end up in spreadsheet and word hell.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Testing Before Launch</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Particular areas to pay attention to are how fast or how slow the website is loading at the user’s end so that the first impression on a new audience is not abysmal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Testing and improvement should continue after the website is up and running. The business should necessarily request for feedback through surveys. This will increase the conversion rate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Linguistic testing should check that every word appearing on the website is correctly translated, accurate and 100% understood by the intended audience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Localization testing should check encryption algorithms, hardware compatibility, units of measurement, names, date, time, entry fields, links, etc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>All images should be appropriate.</li><li>The website should load correctly on all kinds of mobile devices and browsers.</li><li>Images shouldn’t take time to load and videos shouldn’t buffer or struggle to start.</li><li>Programmers must be made to streamline the HTML, remove unnecessary CSS and optimize the JavaScript. </li><li>A Content Delivery Network, or CDN helps by using local servers to speed up the loading of a website.</li><li>QA should be split out over regions and made to go through all site forms to check their function and look for broken design.</li><li>If the website is burdened with too much image and video, site speed will be slower than what a user might be willing to tolerate. It is better to shave off imagery and visualisations that you think are important than have 40% of potential consumers leave the website after waiting for more than three seconds for it to load.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Just Keep Calm and Do Your Best</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Website localization certainly seems daunting. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But our curation of best practices should get you through it.

It provides a centralized platform for managing tags and events outside of the site’s source code. It makes it a fantastic resource for marketers. It can help them implement tags on their own without relying on limited developer resources. Tags are vital for conversion tracking and measuring results. The ability to quickly update and modify tags can be game-changing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>What is it?</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Have you ever noticed that your Google Analytics account is showing incorrect sessions, conversions, etc. or not working properly because of incorrect implementation of <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/\">Google Analytics</a> or your developer is not familiar with setting up Google Analytics? Google Tag Manager is a perfect tool for you to implement all the codes without any hassle provided that you are comfortable with JavaScript, web applications, and web servers. Migrating Google Analytics to Google Tag Manager can be as daunting as a new tag implementation on the entire site. On large sites, implementing a tag manager like GTM may impose serious challenges, if not implemented correctly.

In 1958, U.S. corporations remained on that index for an average of 61 years, according to the American Enterprise Foundation. By 2011, it was 18 years. Today, companies are being replaced on the S&amp;P approximately every two weeks. Technology has driven this shift, and companies that want to succeed must understand how to merge technology with strategy.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Enterprise leaders have largely gotten the message – and are prioritizing accordingly. IDC forecasts that worldwide spending on technologies and services that enable digital transformation will reach $1.97 trillion in 2022, per the (IDC) Worldwide Semiannual Digital Transformation Spending Guide. IDC predicts that digital transformation spending will grow steadily, achieving a five-year compound annual growth rate of 16.7 percent between 2017 and 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"This shift toward capital funding is an important one as business executives come to recognize digital transformation as a long-term investment.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“IDC predicts that, by 2020, 30 percent of G2000 companies will have allocated capital budget equal to at least 10 percent of revenue to fuel their digital strategies,\" said Shawn Fitzgerald, research director, Worldwide Digital Transformation Strategies. “This shift toward capital funding is an important one as business executives come to recognize digital transformation as a long-term investment. This commitment to funding DX will continue to drive spending well into the next decade.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As of 2018, advanced analytics is the number-one digital investment – with enterprises planning to increase related deployments by 75 percent during the next 12 to 18 months, according to research from The Hackett Group. This includes a particular emphasis on data visualization tools and machine learning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Organizations are at different places in the digital transformation journey, of course. But speed has become a business imperative for all. IT leaders face pressure to show that digital initiatives continue to translate to increased agility and speed for the entire organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As Dion Hinchcliffe, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research, writes: “The top IT executives in today\'s rapidly evolving organizations must match the pace of change, fall behind, or lead the pack. That\'s the existential issue at stake in today\'s digitally-infused times, where bold action must be actively supported by out-of-the-box experimentation and pathfinding. This must be done while managing the inexorable daily drumbeat of operational issues, service delivery, and the distracting vagaries of the unpredictable, such as a major cyberattack or information breach. The CIO this year must be both a supremely masterful priority juggler and an effective digital leader from the front.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Improving customer experience has become a crucial goal – and thus a crucial part of digital transformation. Hinchcliffe calls seamless customer experience “the most important discriminating factor for how a business will perform.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What does a digital transformation framework look like?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although digital transformation will vary widely based on organization\'s specific challenges and demands, there are a few constants and common themes among existing case studies and published frameworks that all business and technology leaders should consider as they embark on digital transformation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>For instance, these digital transformation elements are often cited:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Customer experience</strong></li><li><strong>Operational agility</strong></li><li><strong>Culture and leadership</strong></li><li><strong>Workforce enablement</strong></li><li><strong>Digital technology integration</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While each guide has its own recommendations and varying steps or considerations, CIOs should look for those important shared themes when developing their own digital transformation strategy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What role does culture play in digital transformation?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In recent years, IT\'s role has fundamentally shifted. CEOs increasingly want their CIOs to help generate revenue for the organization. According to the 2018 Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey of more than 4,600 CIOs, the CIO\'s top operational priority is “improving business process.\" But among CIOs at \'digital leaders\' – companies identified as top performers – the CIO\'s top operational priority is “developing innovative new products.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rather than focusing on cost savings, IT has become the primary driver of business innovation. Embracing this shift requires everyone in the company to rethink the role and impact of IT in their day-to-day experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bryson Koehler, CTO, Equifax, says, “There is a very different mindset at work when you take IT out of an operating mode of, \'Let’s run a bunch of packaged solutions that we’ve bought and stood up\' to \'Let’s build and create new capabilities that didn’t exist before.\' If you look at the vast majority of startups, they’re not starting with giant, shrink-wrapped software packages as the base of their company. If you’re trying to create innovation inside of a large enterprise then you shouldn’t start with that either. You’re not here to run the mainframe anymore. You’re not here to run the servers. You’re not here to run the data center, or the network, or operations. That is table stakes. That’s what you can outsource.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although IT will play an important role in driving digital transformation strategy, the work of implementing and adapting to the massive changes that go along with digital transformation falls to everyone. For this reason, digital transformation is a people issue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>IT leaders find themselves working in cross-functional teams more than ever. Digital transformation initiatives often reshape workgroups, job titles, and longtime business processes. When people fear their value and perhaps their jobs are at risk, IT leaders will feel the pushback. Thus leadership “soft skills” – which turn out to be rather hard – are in great demand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mattel EVP and CTO Sven Gerjets say leading transformation starts with empathy. “When your empathy is genuine, you begin to build trust,” he says. “If you don’t have an organization that is supportive and fully onboard with the transformation efforts, it’s impossible to succeed. You need to have leaders that know what “good” looks like and who are motivated to help the organization understand why you’re doing what you’re doing.”&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“This will become apparent when you hear things like, \'Hey, we’re working with your team and it feels different,\' or, \'We can’t believe that IT delivered this project early and it met my business needs.\'”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Melissa Swift, who leads Korn Ferry’s Digital Advisory for North America and Global Accounts, finds in her consulting work that three groups of employees tend to slow transformation momentum: Old-timers, by-the-book players, and lone wolves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Companies must not ignore but engage these three groups – or face perilous stalls, she writes. How to do that? Her first suggestion: Think about your population in a segmented fashion, and work to meet different segments where they are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Many organizations,” she writes, “have rolled out the digital journey in a highly uniform manner, with the same messages and techniques deployed throughout. “Re-skilling for everyone! New teams! Welcome to the new world!”&nbsp; From a change management perspective, this is pure folly – and a misuse of investment dollars that might be spent more strategically targeting smaller groups. Companies should consider both digital experience and behavioral preferences of different sub-populations within their organization, and they should craft messaging, programs, and even environments to hit the right starting point and realistic endpoint for different groups.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What drives digital transformation?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An important element of digital transformation is, of course, technology. But often, it\'s more about shedding outdated processes and legacy technology than it is about adopting new tech. The Federal IT Dashboard shows that in fiscal year 2017, over 70 percent of IT spend government-wide went toward operating and maintaining legacy systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the healthcare industry, despite widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices among healthcare providers, “close to 80 percent (79.8 percent) of clinicians continue to use hospital-provided pagers and 49 percent of those clinicians report they receive patient care-related messages most commonly by pager.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Examples like these span all industries, and the prevalence of legacy technology hinders CIOs\' ability to successfully embark on a digital transformation strategy. Research from Forrester suggests, on average, CIOs spend an average of 72 percent of their budgets on existing IT concerns, while only 28 percent goes to new projects and innovation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If businesses want to evolve with the rapid pace of digital change today, they must work to increase efficiency with technology wherever possible. For many, that means adopting agile principles across the business. Automation technologies also help many IT organizations gain speed and reduce technical debt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How can I get started on digital transformation?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If all of this makes you feel woefully behind, fear not. One of the biggest misconceptions CIOs have about digital transformation is that all of their competitors are much further ahead of the game than they are. That\'s because “there’s much admiration of (and popular press around) the fastest transformers, but little critique of how hard transformation is or how long it may take for a typical Global 2,000 company,” says Tim Yeaton, CMO of Red Hat.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As businesses formulate their own digital transformation strategy, there is much to be learned from CIOs and IT leaders who have already begun their journeys.

In 1958, U.S. corporations remained on that index for an average of 61 years, according to the American Enterprise Foundation. By 2011, it was 18 years. Today, companies are being replaced on the S&amp;P approximately every two weeks. Technology has driven this shift, and companies that want to succeed must understand how to merge technology with strategy.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Enterprise leaders have largely gotten the message – and are prioritizing accordingly. IDC forecasts that worldwide spending on technologies and services that enable digital transformation will reach $1.97 trillion in 2022, per the (IDC) Worldwide Semiannual Digital Transformation Spending Guide. IDC predicts that digital transformation spending will grow steadily, achieving a five-year compound annual growth rate of 16.7 percent between 2017 and 2022. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"This shift toward capital funding is an important one as business executives come to recognize digital transformation as a long-term investment.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“IDC predicts that, by 2020, 30 percent of G2000 companies will have allocated capital budget equal to at least 10 percent of revenue to fuel their digital strategies,\" said Shawn Fitzgerald, research director, Worldwide Digital Transformation Strategies. “This shift toward capital funding is an important one as business executives come to recognize digital transformation as a long-term investment. This commitment to funding DX will continue to drive spending well into the next decade.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As of 2018, advanced analytics is the number-one digital investment – with enterprises planning to increase related deployments by 75 percent during the next 12 to 18 months, according to research from The Hackett Group. This includes a particular emphasis on data visualization tools and machine learning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Organizations are at different places in the digital transformation journey, of course. But speed has become a business imperative for all. IT leaders face pressure to show that digital initiatives continue to translate to increased agility and speed for the entire organization. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As Dion Hinchcliffe, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research, writes: “The top IT executives in today\'s rapidly evolving organizations must match the pace of change, fall behind, or lead the pack. That\'s the existential issue at stake in today\'s digitally-infused times, where bold action must be actively supported by out-of-the-box experimentation and pathfinding. This must be done while managing the inexorable daily drumbeat of operational issues, service delivery, and the distracting vagaries of the unpredictable, such as a major cyberattack or information breach. The CIO this year must be both a supremely masterful priority juggler and an effective digital leader from the front.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Improving customer experience has become a crucial goal – and thus a crucial part of digital transformation. Hinchcliffe calls seamless customer experience “the most important discriminating factor for how a business will perform.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What does a digital transformation framework look like?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although digital transformation will vary widely based on organization\'s specific challenges and demands, there are a few constants and common themes among existing case studies and published frameworks that all business and technology leaders should consider as they embark on digital transformation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>For instance, these digital transformation elements are often cited:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Customer experience</strong></li><li><strong>Operational agility</strong></li><li><strong>Culture and leadership</strong></li><li><strong>Workforce enablement</strong></li><li><strong>Digital technology integration</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While each guide has its own recommendations and varying steps or considerations, CIOs should look for those important shared themes when developing their own digital transformation strategy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What role does culture play in digital transformation?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In recent years, IT\'s role has fundamentally shifted. CEOs increasingly want their CIOs to help generate revenue for the organization. According to the 2018 Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey of more than 4,600 CIOs, the CIO\'s top operational priority is “improving business process.\" But among CIOs at \'digital leaders\' – companies identified as top performers – the CIO\'s top operational priority is “developing innovative new products.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rather than focusing on cost savings, IT has become the primary driver of business innovation. Embracing this shift requires everyone in the company to rethink the role and impact of IT in their day-to-day experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bryson Koehler, CTO, Equifax, says, “There is a very different mindset at work when you take IT out of an operating mode of, \'Let’s run a bunch of packaged solutions that we’ve bought and stood up\' to \'Let’s build and create new capabilities that didn’t exist before.\' If you look at the vast majority of startups, they’re not starting with giant, shrink-wrapped software packages as the base of their company. If you’re trying to create innovation inside of a large enterprise then you shouldn’t start with that either. You’re not here to run the mainframe anymore. You’re not here to run the servers. You’re not here to run the data center, or the network, or operations. That is table stakes. That’s what you can outsource.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although IT will play an important role in driving digital transformation strategy, the work of implementing and adapting to the massive changes that go along with digital transformation falls to everyone. For this reason, digital transformation is a people issue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>IT leaders find themselves working in cross-functional teams more than ever. Digital transformation initiatives often reshape workgroups, job titles, and longtime business processes. When people fear their value and perhaps their jobs are at risk, IT leaders will feel the pushback. Thus leadership “soft skills” – which turn out to be rather hard – are in great demand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mattel EVP and CTO Sven Gerjets say leading transformation starts with empathy. “When your empathy is genuine, you begin to build trust,” he says. “If you don’t have an organization that is supportive and fully onboard with the transformation efforts, it’s impossible to succeed. You need to have leaders that know what “good” looks like and who are motivated to help the organization understand why you’re doing what you’re doing.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“This will become apparent when you hear things like, \'Hey, we’re working with your team and it feels different,\' or, \'We can’t believe that IT delivered this project early and it met my business needs.\'”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Melissa Swift, who leads Korn Ferry’s Digital Advisory for North America and Global Accounts, finds in her consulting work that three groups of employees tend to slow transformation momentum: Old-timers, by-the-book players, and lone wolves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Companies must not ignore but engage these three groups – or face perilous stalls, she writes. How to do that? Her first suggestion: Think about your population in a segmented fashion, and work to meet different segments where they are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Many organizations,” she writes, “have rolled out the digital journey in a highly uniform manner, with the same messages and techniques deployed throughout. “Re-skilling for everyone! New teams! Welcome to the new world!”  From a change management perspective, this is pure folly – and a misuse of investment dollars that might be spent more strategically targeting smaller groups. Companies should consider both digital experience and behavioral preferences of different sub-populations within their organization, and they should craft messaging, programs, and even environments to hit the right starting point and realistic endpoint for different groups.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What drives digital transformation?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An important element of digital transformation is, of course, technology. But often, it\'s more about shedding outdated processes and legacy technology than it is about adopting new tech. The Federal IT Dashboard shows that in fiscal year 2017, over 70 percent of IT spend government-wide went toward operating and maintaining legacy systems. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the healthcare industry, despite widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices among healthcare providers, “close to 80 percent (79.8 percent) of clinicians continue to use hospital-provided pagers and 49 percent of those clinicians report they receive patient care-related messages most commonly by pager.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Examples like these span all industries, and the prevalence of legacy technology hinders CIOs\' ability to successfully embark on a digital transformation strategy. Research from Forrester suggests, on average, CIOs spend an average of 72 percent of their budgets on existing IT concerns, while only 28 percent goes to new projects and innovation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If businesses want to evolve with the rapid pace of digital change today, they must work to increase efficiency with technology wherever possible. For many, that means adopting agile principles across the business. Automation technologies also help many IT organizations gain speed and reduce technical debt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How can I get started on digital transformation?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If all of this makes you feel woefully behind, fear not. One of the biggest misconceptions CIOs have about digital transformation is that all of their competitors are much further ahead of the game than they are. That\'s because “there’s much admiration of (and popular press around) the fastest transformers, but little critique of how hard transformation is or how long it may take for a typical Global 2,000 company,” says Tim Yeaton, CMO of Red Hat. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As businesses formulate their own digital transformation strategy, there is much to be learned from CIOs and IT leaders who have already begun their journeys.

That message comes through loud and clear from seemingly every keynote, panel discussion, article, or study related to how businesses can remain competitive and relevant as the world becomes increasingly digital. What\'s not clear to many business leaders is what digital transformation means. Is it just a catchy way to say moving to the cloud? What are the specific steps we need to take? Do we need to design new jobs to help us create a framework for digital transformation, or hire a consulting service? What parts of our business strategy need to change? Is it really worth it?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This article aims to answer some of the common questions around digital transformation and provide clarity, specifically to CIOs and IT leaders, including lessons learned from your peers and digital transformation experts. Because technology plays a critical role in an organization\'s ability to evolve with the market and continually increase value to customers, CIOs play a key role in digital transformation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It\'s also worth noting that today\'s organizations are in different places on the road to digital transformation. If you are feeling stuck in your digital transformation work, you are not alone. One of the hardest questions in digital transformation is how to get over the initial hump from vision to execution. It creates angst: Many CIOs and organizations think they lag far behind their peers on transformation when that isn\'t the case.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even organizations that are well down the digital transformation path face tough ongoing hurdles, like budgeting, talent struggles, and culture change. Let\'s dig in for advice for organizations at various places on that road to change.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What is digital transformation?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because digital transformation will look different for every company, it can be hard to pinpoint a definition that applies to all. However, in general terms, we define digital transformation as the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business resulting in fundamental changes to how businesses operate and how they deliver value to customers. Beyond that, it\'s a cultural change that requires organizations to continually challenge the status quo, experiment often, and get comfortable with failure. This sometimes means walking away from long-standing business processes that companies were built upon in favor of relatively new practices that are still being defined.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With a plethora of articles and various definitions of digital transformation, it\'s easy to see why there is some confusion around the topic. For instance, author Greg Verdino focuses on what businesses that undergo digital transformation may expect to achieve. He says, “Digital transformation closes the gap between what digital customers already expect and what analog businesses actually deliver.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A definition from The Agile Elephant emphasizes all the ways businesses may need to adjust their existing practices: “[Digital transformation] involves a change in leadership, different thinking, the encouragement of innovation and new business models, incorporating digitization of assets and an increased use of technology to improve the experience of your organization’s employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and stakeholders.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And the Wikipedia definition, while vague, touches on how the effects of digital transformation extend beyond businesses to society as a whole. “Digital transformation is the changes associated with the application of digital technology in all aspects of human society,” it states.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Why does digital transformation matter?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A business may take on digital transformation for several reasons. But by far, the most likely reason is that they have to: It\'s a survival issue for many.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Howard King, in a contributed article for The Guardian, puts it this way: “Businesses don\'t transform by choice because it is expensive and risky. Businesses go through transformation when they have failed to evolve.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>John Marcante, CIO of Vanguard, points this out, as well: “Just look at the S&amp;P 500. In 1958, U.S. corporations remained on that index for an average of 61 years, according to the American Enterprise Foundation. By 2011, it was 18 years. Today, companies are being replaced on the S&amp;P approximately every two weeks. Technology has driven this shift, and companies that want to succeed must understand how to merge technology with strategy.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Enterprise leaders have largely gotten the message – and are prioritizing accordingly. IDC forecasts that worldwide spending on technologies and services that enable digital transformation will reach $1.97 trillion in 2022, per the (IDC) Worldwide Semiannual Digital Transformation Spending Guide. IDC predicts that digital transformation spending will grow steadily, achieving a five-year compound annual growth rate of 16.7 percent between 2017 and 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"This shift toward capital funding is an important one as business executives come to recognize digital transformation as a long-term investment.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“IDC predicts that, by 2020, 30 percent of G2000 companies will have allocated capital budget equal to at least 10 percent of revenue to fuel their digital strategies,\" said Shawn Fitzgerald, research director, Worldwide Digital Transformation Strategies. “This shift toward capital funding is an important one as business executives come to recognize digital transformation as a long-term investment. This commitment to funding DX will continue to drive spending well into the next decade.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As of 2018, advanced analytics is the number-one digital investment – with enterprises planning to increase related deployments by 75 percent during the next 12 to 18 months, according to research from The Hackett Group. This includes a particular emphasis on data visualization tools and machine learning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Organizations are at different places in the digital transformation journey, of course. But speed has become a business imperative for all. IT leaders face pressure to show that digital initiatives continue to translate to increased agility and speed for the entire organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As Dion Hinchcliffe, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research, writes: “The top IT executives in today\'s rapidly evolving organizations must match the pace of change, fall behind, or lead the pack. That\'s the existential issue at stake in today\'s digitally-infused times, where bold action must be actively supported by out-of-the-box experimentation and pathfinding. This must be done while managing the inexorable daily drumbeat of operational issues, service delivery, and the distracting vagaries of the unpredictable, such as a major cyberattack or information breach. The CIO this year must be both a supremely masterful priority juggler and an effective digital leader from the front.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Improving customer experience has become a crucial goal – and thus a crucial part of digital transformation. Hinchcliffe calls seamless customer experience “the most important discriminating factor for how a business will perform.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What does a digital transformation framework look like?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although digital transformation will vary widely based on organization\'s specific challenges and demands, there are a few constants and common themes among existing case studies and published frameworks that all business and technology leaders should consider as they embark on digital transformation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>For instance, these digital transformation elements are often cited:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Customer experience</strong></li><li><strong>Operational agility</strong></li><li><strong>Culture and leadership</strong></li><li><strong>Workforce enablement</strong></li><li><strong>Digital technology integration</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While each guide has its own recommendations and varying steps or considerations, CIOs should look for those important shared themes when developing their own digital transformation strategy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What role does culture play in digital transformation?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In recent years, IT\'s role has fundamentally shifted. CEOs increasingly want their CIOs to help generate revenue for the organization. According to the 2018 Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey of more than 4,600 CIOs, the CIO\'s top operational priority is “improving business process.\" But among CIOs at \'digital leaders\' – companies identified as top performers – the CIO\'s top operational priority is “developing innovative new products.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rather than focusing on cost savings, IT has become the primary driver of business innovation. Embracing this shift requires everyone in the company to rethink the role and impact of IT in their day-to-day experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bryson Koehler, CTO, Equifax, says, “There is a very different mindset at work when you take IT out of an operating mode of, \'Let’s run a bunch of packaged solutions that we’ve bought and stood up\' to \'Let’s build and create new capabilities that didn’t exist before.\' If you look at the vast majority of startups, they’re not starting with giant, shrink-wrapped software packages as the base of their company. If you’re trying to create innovation inside of a large enterprise then you shouldn’t start with that either. You’re not here to run the mainframe anymore. You’re not here to run the servers. You’re not here to run the data center, or the network, or operations. That is table stakes. That’s what you can outsource.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although IT will play an important role in driving digital transformation strategy, the work of implementing and adapting to the massive changes that go along with digital transformation falls to everyone. For this reason, digital transformation is a people issue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>IT leaders find themselves working in cross-functional teams more than ever. Digital transformation initiatives often reshape workgroups, job titles, and longtime business processes. When people fear their value and perhaps their jobs are at risk, IT leaders will feel the pushback. Thus leadership “soft skills” – which turn out to be rather hard – are in great demand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mattel EVP and CTO Sven Gerjets say leading transformation starts with empathy. “When your empathy is genuine, you begin to build trust,” he says. “If you don’t have an organization that is supportive and fully onboard with the transformation efforts, it’s impossible to succeed. You need to have leaders that know what “good” looks like and who are motivated to help the organization understand why you’re doing what you’re doing.”&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“This will become apparent when you hear things like, \'Hey, we’re working with your team and it feels different,\' or, \'We can’t believe that IT delivered this project early and it met my business needs.\'”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Melissa Swift, who leads Korn Ferry’s Digital Advisory for North America and Global Accounts, finds in her consulting work that three groups of employees tend to slow transformation momentum: Old-timers, by-the-book players, and lone wolves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Companies must not ignore but engage these three groups – or face perilous stalls, she writes. How to do that? Her first suggestion: Think about your population in a segmented fashion, and work to meet different segments where they are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Many organizations,” she writes, “have rolled out the digital journey in a highly uniform manner, with the same messages and techniques deployed throughout. “Re-skilling for everyone! New teams! Welcome to the new world!”&nbsp; From a change management perspective, this is pure folly – and a misuse of investment dollars that might be spent more strategically targeting smaller groups. Companies should consider both digital experience and behavioral preferences of different sub-populations within their organization, and they should craft messaging, programs, and even environments to hit the right starting point and realistic endpoint for different groups.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What drives digital transformation?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An important element of digital transformation is, of course, technology. But often, it\'s more about shedding outdated processes and legacy technology than it is about adopting new tech. The Federal IT Dashboard shows that in fiscal year 2017, over 70 percent of IT spend government-wide went toward operating and maintaining legacy systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the healthcare industry, despite widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices among healthcare providers, “close to 80 percent (79.8 percent) of clinicians continue to use hospital-provided pagers and 49 percent of those clinicians report they receive patient care-related messages most commonly by pager.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Examples like these span all industries, and the prevalence of legacy technology hinders CIOs\' ability to successfully embark on a digital transformation strategy. Research from Forrester suggests, on average, CIOs spend an average of 72 percent of their budgets on existing IT concerns, while only 28 percent goes to new projects and innovation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If businesses want to evolve with the rapid pace of digital change today, they must work to increase efficiency with technology wherever possible. For many, that means adopting agile principles across the business. Automation technologies also help many IT organizations gain speed and reduce technical debt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How can I get started on digital transformation?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If all of this makes you feel woefully behind, fear not. One of the biggest misconceptions CIOs have about digital transformation is that all of their competitors are much further ahead of the game than they are. That\'s because “there’s much admiration of (and popular press around) the fastest transformers, but little critique of how hard transformation is or how long it may take for a typical Global 2,000 company,” says Tim Yeaton, CMO of Red Hat.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As businesses formulate their own digital transformation strategy, there is much to be learned from CIOs and IT leaders who have already begun their journeys.

A localized website is a specialist in conveying a special kind of information that cannot be achieved with mere machine translation. Unlike a generic stock brand webpage, the localized website is especially suited for meeting a customer’s needs, be it cultural, currency-based, language-based or the desire for products or services with a personal touch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To help your brand website emote and communicate like a native and appear inviting and pleasant to a local populace, we have uncovered the following 5 secrets to successfully localized websites:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Identifying a Target Market </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":149} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-149\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first logical step is deciding in which country to market a brand’s products and services. The following questions help to shape this decision:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Is the country interested in the product?</li><li>Will the targeted consumer willingly choose the brand?</li><li>Can the business survive the already existing competition?</li><li>Is the brand’s product or service affordable to the targeted consumer?</li><li>Does that country’s market promise a healthy growth rate?</li><li>Are product delivery costs in the country manageable?</li><li>Is Customer Support in the local tongue affordable for the business?</li><li>Will the ROI justify the investment in website localization?</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The sensible thing to do is to first enter a market where there is the highest probability of the product getting sold. As costs can increase with multiple target countries and languages, it is better to start small and go with the flow until the brand finds new emerging markets.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the brand’s product is a bestseller in one particular region, it should be treated like a benchmark around which the rest of the business plan can be figured out.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The objective is to reach the highest number of potential customers without crossing the budget. After the marketing and financial indicators mentioned above have been studied, a business should consider the experiences of others regarding specific markets and learn from that as well. For example - the stories of Nike and Mercedes-Benz in China clearly prove that the cultural appropriateness of a product and its marketing technique are MORE IMPORTANT than plain statistics. China has a MASSIVE customer base (a misleading statistic from a business perspective) that is mostly untapped. This is because the localized websites operating here till date had been initially forced to explore the market without rock-solid guidance or expertise in Chinese culture and linguistics. Let\'s see what happened.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Nike</strong>: They designed white sneakers for The Year of the Monkey. The Chinese character on the left shoe, Fa (發), supposedly means good fortune. The character on the right shoe, Fu (福), is believed to denote wealth. Nike understandably thought that they have invented an excellent marketing gimmick. Despite their sincere efforts, this gimmick bombed. What they failed to grasp is that Chinese characters change in meaning when used in combination. So when the wearer of the sneakers joined heels, the resulting message, instead of “good fortune and wealth,” read “fat!”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong>: This company chose the phonetically-similar name “Ben-Si” (奔死), instead of “Benz,” to penetrate the Chinese market. But when they unwittingly implemented this decision, the two characters “Ben” and “Si,” when combined, advertized to Chinese consumers a brand name “run to death!”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Moral</strong>: Every market or country has its own quirks and unique qualities that have to be looked into so that disasters like the ones mentioned here can be avoided.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Build your Business from Scratch Around a Localized Website</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As of <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/\">October 2019</a>, 58% of earth’s population is now online. That amounts to a staggering 4.48 billion users worldwide; with China, India and the United States leading the way. While this huge number may not be an established consumer base for a particular brand, it certainly is a market filled with potential that shouldn\'t be left unutilized. So obviously if a business ignores this global market and instead confines itself to a single country or continent, it is missing out. Which is why in this day and age, building (and growing) a business and localizing the business website for a number of regions go hand-in-hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another interesting business insight is that consumer behaviour across the globe is now following similar trends, if not&nbsp; the same trend. Unlike earlier, if a product is successful in one particular geography there isn’t any reason why it shouldn’t do well in another. <strong>Important</strong>: While the demand for a particular product can be felt in the same strong way the world over, no one has said that it needs to be marketed in the same way everywhere.&nbsp; Hence the need to communicate in the local language. Hence the need for localized websites!<br><strong>Let’s drop yet another significant fact</strong>: English remains to be the most widespread and most used language, but other languages, particularly Chinese, are catching up. 72.4% of global shoppers prefer to use their native language when shopping online. 55% of global shoppers only buy products from websites that give information in their native language. 56.2% of the world’s consumers find the ability to obtain information in their own language to be more important than price. These <a href=\"http://www.oneskyapp.com/blog/14-compelling-statistics-about-the-importance-of-localization/\">facts and figures</a> clearly show the need for a localized website. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Keeping Design Flexible</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":150} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-150\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The average word length of the English language is 4.7 characters. Languages like German and Mongolian have average word lengths between 11.5 and 12. The distribution of <a href=\"http://www.ravi.io/language-word-lengths\">word lengths</a> in various languages is vastly varied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we apply this fact to a practical context, like trying to squeeze the German text “in den Warenkorb legen” on a button that originally read “Add to Cart” in English, we can appreciate the importance of this fact.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arabic text has a right-to-left reading direction. Chinese, Japanese and Korean texts are written and read vertically.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Therefore, keeping all these variances in mind, it makes sense to keep the website design flexible and leave at least 20% extra space within menus and buttons. A cluttered layout and hard-coded CTA URLs lead to broken design, string collapse, haphazard navigation and slow speed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So giving a website plenty of breathing space is the best way to insure it against different internet speeds in different regions. Keeping a website light by minimizing the amount of visual imagery helps it run faster. Also, keeping the quantity of images under control makes tailoring and localizing it a lot less time-consuming.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> “Internationalizing” a Website by using Unicode</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A total of 110–116 different characters exist across the different languages of the world. It is a happy thought that a website doesn\'t necessarily need to display each and every one of them. But a point to consider is that some or many of them may end up as strange symbols instead of being displayed correctly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unicode is used to counter this problem. The UTF-8 encoding format is reliable for handling most compatibility issues. UTF-16 is better suited for Chinese, Japanese and Devanagari.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Developers divide source codes and separate translatable strings so that translators can help them to adapt all the existing website data to the new language. Content is separated from the code and stored so that future website localization operations don’t require a repeat of breaking strings. Local preferences like the formats of mail addresses, data and time, numbers, calendars, currency, shipping address, etc have to have codes enabled. This functionality helps users make decisions on buying products and services without having to work out the math. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Local Keyword Research</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":151} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-151\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Google Search doesn’t enjoy a presence in each and every nation on earth. Freshly localized websites need to feature in the results page of native search engines. Baidu is the most popular search engine in China. Yandex is the most popular search engine in Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The keywords that are required to do this cannot be merely translated. A&nbsp; local SEO specialist is required to identify the right terms that the translator can include on the website immediately. Backlink creation is also something that needs to be done from scratch. A list of keywords needs to be drawn up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Translators then check the list for on-page and off-page applicability. They check metadata, the keyword density on the website and external link anchors.<br><strong>Important</strong>: a localized website isn’t just for markets differentiated by language. It has been observed that some nations that speak the same language like the UK and the USA, Mexico and Argentina, etc don\'t speak the common language in the same way. To make sure that a business website has a good position on the SERP, some solid keyword research is required to make sure that everyone involved in the business fully understands the differences in vocabulary between <a href=\"https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/six-difference-between-britsh-and-american-english/3063743.html\">two countries divided by a common language</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Apart from Language Translation...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> In addition to linguistic translation efforts; images, messages, and even colors have to be localised for a target audience. For example, Australia doesn’t play in the snow in December. Also, any user, anywhere any the world, unconsciously responds better to imagery that contains the same ethnicity as the target market. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Attention to Local Law and Regulations</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Every nation has different laws and regulations concerning terms of service, privacy, data protection, etc. For example, GDPR does not apply as harshly or strictly elsewhere in the world as it does within the EU, unless specifically mandated by the European Parliament or Union or by a country like Australia that has an overlap of the GDPR with its own Privacy Principles. To wade through these legal waters, the services of a local legal specialist is NOT an extravagance. Rather, one should think about how the cost is a lot LESS than any legal fee incurred on violating local law. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Localized Social Media Strategy</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Some quick facts</strong>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Norway and Australia are the only two countries where <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-social-network-users-2019\">Snapchat</a> is more popular than Instagram.&nbsp;</li><li>India has 270 million Facebook users. Next comes the US, with 190. Third place is taken by Indonesia with 130 million. Facebook is banned in Bangladesh, China, Iran and North Korea.&nbsp;</li><li>Twitter is banned in China, Iran and North Korea. The US is the top twitter base at 47 million users. Japan comes next at 38.6 million. The UK comes third with 13.6 million.&nbsp;</li><li>China leads in LinkedIn use with 40.6 million users. Brazil is next with 32.6 million. The UK is third at 22.7 million. LinkedIn is blocked in Russia.</li><li>China, Iran and Korea have blocked Instagram completely. The US has the biggest number of Instagram users, 110 million. Brazil is at second place with 57 million and Indonesia comes next at 53 million.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Clearly, the right platform has to be used when building reach and engaging consumers. The localised website should display the right social sharing buttons.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Excellent Bonding and Cohesion in the Team</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Localization is hard is because there are a lot of people involved.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A successful business needs people on board who understand what makes the market tick. This includes translators, preferably native. They should be good at transcreation. Developers should be able to work well and collaborate with translators. The nature of the undertaking of localizing a website is such that the team is likely to be distributed across different time zones and geographies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Localized Customer Support</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Customers appreciate support in their native language. A business should provide its consumers with local phone numbers and addresses if it can. It makes the business appear more reliable, trustworthy and approachable to its customers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Customer Support should be trained and prepared to handle inquiries in local languages. In case hiring native speaking staff exceeds the budget, templates in all languages that answer common questions should be made visible and available.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Convenient Payment Options</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":152} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a critical parameter. Getting a bunch of new customers to the checkout page takes quite some work. Losing them at this point is VERY disappointing. If a willing consumer doesn’t find preferred payment options, It’ll take nothing for him to just&nbsp; click out of his browser and just forget about the whole thing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To make sure that isn\'t the case ever, here’s a handy list of <a href=\"https://addons.prestashop.com/en/content/35-the-most-popular-online-payment-methods-by-country\">payment options by country</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Translation Management Software</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Manually localizing a website is legitimately one of the worst things a human being can do to himself. Spreadsheets and emails have a margin of error that is just too high.&nbsp;<br>The right translation management tool allows translators to type directly onto the website. Use this convenient <a href=\"http://capterra.com/translation-management-software/\">list</a> to find a software package that can let your project management, developers and translators localize your brand website with ease. It is better to invest in a software than to try to save money in this area and end up in spreadsheet and word hell.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Testing Before Launch</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Particular areas to pay attention to are how fast or how slow the website is loading at the user’s end so that the first impression on a new audience is not abysmal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Testing and improvement should continue after the website is up and running. The business should necessarily request for feedback through surveys. This will increase the conversion rate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Linguistic testing should check that every word appearing on the website is correctly translated, accurate and 100% understood by the intended audience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Localization testing should check encryption algorithms, hardware compatibility, units of measurement, names, date, time, entry fields, links, etc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>All images should be appropriate.</li><li>The website should load correctly on all kinds of mobile devices and browsers.</li><li>Images shouldn’t take time to load and videos shouldn’t buffer or struggle to start.</li><li>Programmers must be made to streamline the HTML, remove unnecessary CSS and optimize the JavaScript.&nbsp;</li><li>A Content Delivery Network, or CDN helps by using local servers to speed up the loading of a website.</li><li>QA should be split out over regions and made to go through all site forms to check their function and look for broken design.</li><li>If the website is burdened with too much image and video, site speed will be slower than what a user might be willing to tolerate. It is better to shave off imagery and visualisations that you think are important than have 40% of potential consumers leave the website after waiting for more than three seconds for it to load.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Just Keep Calm and Do Your Best</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Website localization certainly seems daunting.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But our curation of best practices should get you through it.

No matter how evolved technology gets and user expectations change; a website has to fulfill certain basic criteria: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>A Navigation Module for easy travel throughout the website.</li><li>Content that makes sense and is relevant to the business objective.</li><li>Chat Support.</li><li>The relevance of any and all Imagery used.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Here we must note that e-commerce sites are now shifting away from taking a customer through several screens for a transaction to the newer one-page application. No longer does a customer have to follow prompts and input data on multiple screens until he can finally checkout and make payments on a final screen. Now customers are starting to execute an entire transaction on a single page form. This results in a far more pleasant and streamlined transactional experience for a customer. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Fluid layouts, Organic Design &amp; Elements </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":104} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The-Top-9-Website-Designing-Trends-Shaping-2020-001.jpg\" alt=\"The Top 9 Website Designing Trends Shaping 2020-001\" class=\"wp-image-104\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is one of the latest big developments that is going to stay strong in 2020!&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A broken grid allows the freedom and fluidity to play around with the overall design of a webpage and base its layout elements based on a customer’s user experience. Asymmetrical layouts are currently the rage among UX designers and show no sign of cooling off as we head into 2020.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Designers are clearly shifting away from the rigidity of the conventional rectangles, squares and circles to more “fluid” or “organic” shapes. The reasoning for this is the fact that Mother Nature is not a symmetry lover. It is we human beings that like straight lines. Gentler and slightly “imperfect” lines and shapes are more pleasant to the sensibilities of a human user and this is being incorporated more and more in all areas of website design. Geometric shapes with sharp edges have been used for a long time now in website design. This is because they instil a sense of reliability and trustworthiness in the user. But a point to note here is that these feel a bit too “artificial” and machine-like. Users are now craving for a more human touch and responding well to it.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Certain businesses have to have more than one primary focus, and a split-screen layout allows just that. One must realize that information overload, i.e., overwhelming a user with too much content is an ever-present concern. Split-screen designs can overcome this hurdle handling larger volumes of knowledge and communication. When they’re used after careful consideration, they are rather effective as they make use of visual storytelling.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Flat Design </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This emerging trend too is here to stay. The demand for fast loading and performance-driven websites is ever-increasing. More and more internet users are now venturing to mobile devices instead of conventional large-sized desktop or laptop computers. The demand for a mobile responsive website is on the rise. The current app development platforms and businesses are now making this flat design trend go viral.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A minimalist approach utilizing clean and open space, vibrant colors and simple 2D illustrations is what helps a website load fast on a user’s mobile device and yet remain interesting and stay popular. The resulting website is less data-heavy, thereby demanding less of hardware resources.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Failing to acknowledge and work with this trend will result in a high bounce rate. A “bounce” describes the user behavior of landing on a website and finding it either (i) too heavy with information, (ii) difficult to navigate or (iii) just plain unattractive and then eventually leaving the website.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A high bounce rate will ultimately affect a website’s search ranking as the Google algorithm clearly favors responsive designs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Pronounced Shift from Conventional Content and Graphics </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>(i) GIFs -</strong> Instant gratification is the new norm. You as a brand website have a mere few seconds to grab a visitor\'s attention and deliver on their need for information. GIFs are able to address this need perfectly as they are ideal for presenting a complex concept in an entertaining and quick way. They are also quite light on both desktop and mobile browsers as they hardly take up any data.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>(ii) Other Animation -</strong> Websites use videos and complex animations to draw a user in and keep him hooked on the content. The banners and specific texts on a page are animated to activate when the page is being refreshed. Scroll-triggered animations that activate when a user starts to scroll in search of more content helps to maintain the same level of expectation and enthusiasm from the website and the user takes his time to consider the other available content before clicking on a call to action or eventually clicking out of the website.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The presence of animation all over a website but in a sensible and tasteful way increases user participation and retention. It should be noted here that this is only the case when we use animation sparingly. We don\'t want the animation to be the star of the show. We’re just trying to get the animation to make our content the star of the show. Ideally, animation adds more to the website functionality of conversion rather than its visual appeal. This is a point that is easily and readily be overlooked.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>(iii) Full-Screen Imagery Vs Image Carousels -</strong> once an eye-catching feature found on most websites, Image Carousels are now fading out of use.

Both Graphic and Web Design is about affecting the user experience by evoking emotion. The Biggest Secrets Of Graphic Design are everything to do with the art of psychology. We will learn the process and secrets of how to make a consumer HAPPY with the power of Graphic Design below. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Prepare and Organize </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":115} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/5-Secrets-Of-Successful-Graphic-Design-001.jpg\" alt=\"5 Secrets Of Successful Graphic Design-01\" class=\"wp-image-115\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> The first of the secrets of graphic design is actually not a secret at all - it’s just plain and simple common sense. Like Mise-en-place in cooking, a graphic designer tries to form a mental picture first with intel on business goals and the targeted audience and also tries to get his hands on the approved content. With a complete understanding of the project’s technical and business requirements, and armed with the appropriate style guidelines and templates, a graphic designer is ready to bulldoze through a creative slump, identify obstacles, develop countermeasures and seek inspiration. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2> Create Storyboards </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":116} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/5-Secrets-Of-Successful-Graphic-Design-02.jpg\" alt=\"5 Secrets Of Successful Graphic Design-02\" class=\"wp-image-116\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> The foundation of a good design is a well-thought-out Storyboard, i.e. a Thumbnail. Build intention first, instead of proceeding to incorporate the content and language received after you have been given the design duties. Build intention by creating digital or physical thumbnails. Create early concepts for logos and webpages, slides, whatever; to get your brain chugging and to keep producing ideas. The point here to note is that this isn’t the stage to get attached to an initial early-stage idea as that will hinder the creative process. It is important to be open to others and most of all your own creative mind for making changes to your prototype. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Tinker, Tweak and Play around with the allotted SPACE </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> The idea here is to play with space, visual elements and layout of your design until an optimum balance of aesthetics and functionality is achieved. The user’s eyes need relief and calm, even if the design is meant to arrest attention and lead to conversion. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>(i) Borders and lines -</strong> are helpful for aesthetic and logical segregation of content as per the theme, but when included incorrectly they just promote visual clutter and are unpleasant to look at.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>(ii) Padding:</strong> the reader’s eyes need some breathing room around tightly-packed and congested characters. Providing space between letters reduces eye-fatigue. Space can be adjusted either by kerning, which we’ll discuss below or by changing line-height or space between lines of text. Increasing gaps between headers and body copy material calm the reader\'s eyes by providing much-needed visual breaks. We want the reader to feel that he has gained valuable information and inspiration about a product or idea. We’re not trying to overwhelm him with text and graphic data.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>(iii) Font &amp; Style Hierarchy:</strong> Using the same font size and style across the board is a recipe for disaster! Instead of imparting a sense of uniformity, it just makes everything look <strong>“heavy,”</strong> or cluttered. Going overboard with this ends up at the same problem.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> <strong>(iv) Adjust Kerning to banish Orphans and Widows!</strong> - Sounds cruel? Well, it’s a cruel world! Jokes aside, the straggling solo words at the end of paragraphs have the potential to make the entire visual presentation appear lopsided. These loners, isolated words are called <strong>“Orphans”</strong> or <strong>“Widows”</strong> <strong>“Kerning”</strong> is the practice of adjusting the space between letters to kick these orphans or widows out of your home! </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Now for one of the Biggest Secrets of Graphic Design: The TACTICAL USE of COLOUR. </h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":117} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/5-Secrets-Of-Successful-Graphic-Design-03.jpg\" alt=\"5 Secrets Of Successful Graphic Design-03\" class=\"wp-image-117\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Colour = Emotion.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\n\nEmotion = liking a brand and sticking to it.\n\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/2017/03/color-theory-design/\">here</a> to view an amazing breakdown of color psychology.&nbsp;<br>The right color can send a highly personalized and convincing message to an audience.

The way people perceive your business can often be more important than the things you offer! Despite that, not a lot of people see that.

If your business doesn’t have any USP, how you going to decide the tone and things while marketing your business. Let me make it more simple for you, When we see a logo of Mcdonald’s the very first thing comes in our mind is “Burgers”. You know why? Because that’s their USP, that makes them stand out from other fast-food chains. So, before marketing your business, you need to figure out what’s your or your business’s USP.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Branding is just a name and logo:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Logo, the name of your business is a part of your branding, but branding is much more than a name or a logo.&nbsp;Branding is all about the feelings, features, and emotions associated with your company. Let’s take the example&nbsp;of the “Liverpool Football Club”. We all are very well aware of LFC, the fans of LFC have an emotional attachment with it, that’s made the Liverpool Football club so popular among all the football fan across the world.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Customers only care about product / service:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Actually, customers care a lot about choosing a brand that appeals to them and are able to connect with. A&nbsp;stuntman or a fan of extreme sports are more likely to pick a Red Bull energy drink over, for example, a Monster.&nbsp;That’s because Red Bull promotes themselves among these groups of people. Or, imagine walking into a drugstore&nbsp;looking for toothpaste. Which one are you more likely to pick? The one you saw an advertisement of (it showed&nbsp;footage of smiling people with perfectly white teeth) or some other random paste you’ve never heard about.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, obviously the first one! According to Malcolm Gladwell: “Buyers make most decisions by relying on their&nbsp;two-second first impressions based on stored memories, images and feelings” (Gladwell, The Power of Thinking Without Thinking) – that means, an advertisement you saw some time ago is now embedded in your brain and will impact your choices! No matter how good the other toothpaste is, or how bad the first one might be, you will most likely choose the one you are familiar with.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Branding will not make you any money:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s true, it won’t. The sales of your product or service will make you money. Consistent branding across all channels increases revenue by 23%. Branding is what will make the customers choose what you offer instead of what somebody else is offering. So like, in the long run, it will make you money!<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Branding is only about product or service:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The CEO example, I wrote about above already cracks this premise. However, think of customer service – the&nbsp;experience you get when getting your problem solved by a company representative can largely impact the way&nbsp;you perceive the entire structure. True – the products or services are what drives your company forward, but&nbsp;it’s all about the aftertaste that a transaction leaves. Brand equity can be largely impacted by the quality&nbsp;of customer service.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Branding isn\'t necessary:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many company owners believe that if they create a decent product and provide good service at the right price, the company will succeed. While those are things that every company should be doing, they will only get you so far. Consumers tend to rely on emotion rather than logic when making purchase decisions, and this is where branding your company and its products can make a difference. If your branding triggers a positive emotional response in consumers’ minds, it can mean the difference between a sale or a consumer who walks away.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Branding is expensive:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, it’s true that like big brands like Amazon or Pepsi spend a hell lot of money in their marketing. But branding&nbsp;your business is entirely depends on what’s the market size of your business. You don’t need to spend millions like&nbsp;Amazon or eBay. You can promote your brand with a small budget. The only thing you need to take care of that you deliver the exact thing to your customers what your brand claims. The marketing of your brand absolutely runs on emotions. So, keep your brand tone even and interactive while marketing your brand. For example, Starbucks built their brand with one single mission “Our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.” Unlike other brands, Starbucks focuses on the importance of building a community of happy and satisfied customers one step at a time. That’s made Starbucks one of the popular brands in the world.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are low on budget then read <a href=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/2019/09/10/how-to-promote-your-business-online/\">how to promote your business when you’re low on your budget.</a><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Branding is a one-shot deal:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is one of the biggest misconceptions most people have. No matter how big is your brand and how much effort you made in your branding, every business needs to review and revise their branding strategy regularly or the result will be devastating. The big example of this is “Nestle”. A few years back “<a href=\"https://www.nestle.com\">Nestle</a>” wasn’t focusing on managing their online brand management and that cost them a loss of millions. Brands like Coca-cola, Starbucks and other popular brands take care of this thing and always revise their strategy of branding.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Consumers don’t really care what the brand looks like:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a common thought among people who are in industries that are less glamorous or those that have traditionally not focus much on looking good. However, consumers are much more intuitive than what business owners perceive these days.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>“Buyers make most decisions by relying on their two-second first impressions based on stored memories, images, and feelings.”</strong><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And most often than not, these first impressions are based on your outward appearance, which is evident right away, before they decide whether to dig deeper into your brand.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the end of the day, no matter what brand the consumer choose, they still desire products and services that they are attracted to and that they can connect with. If they feel your website looks dubious or unprofessional, chances are they might not give your brand and services a second look.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What’s more, if you are in a generic market that is lacking in any branding, what do you think would give you an edge to stand out from the crowd?<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Branding isn’t relevant to a small business like ours</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most small businesses may not think much about branding as they associate becoming a “brand” too big spendings by well-known brands. We are talking about glamorous TV or print advertising, celebrity endorsements and publicity stunts by companies such as Apple and Nike.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And it’s true that if we look at branding through this lens, it may seem overwhelming and irrelevant to small businesses. But if we dive deeper, what these activities aim for is to create “brand engagement”, which in essence is just about connecting people with the brand.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, creating a connection with your audience is definitely relevant and essential to all businesses big or small. In fact, I’d say that branding is even more crucial for small companies as they do not have the budget to achieve branding success by pouring money into branding as the big boys do.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Therefore, small businesses have to be smart and strategic about their branding. They can do so by starting small and work on their immediate brand assets to build a strong foundation for growth. With small incremental steps, these branding efforts can one day have a domino effect and make a big difference.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Branding can be done without dedicated specialists:</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Devising a successful branding strategy is far more difficult than it looks.

Namely, integration of software applications in such a way that they use a shared database, integration using service-oriented architecture stacks (point to point direct integration and standalone enterprise service bus integration), robotic process automation and a combination of these approaches. We will learn about the challenges concerning SAP integration by discussing the merits and limitations of each of the 5 approaches below.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Shared database</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A number of software applications are integrated with an underlying shared database. All applications share and use the same data residing in that location. This ensures the data being used in different business processes is uniform as all changes to the data take instantaneous effect. The transmission of the data is relatively fast as it doesn’t have to cross lots of interfaces between the business process software application and the database.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Naturally, like all technology, these advantages of the centralized repository of data shared real-time with integrated software systems, come with some trade-offs:<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Higher risk of entire SAP ERP system failure: </strong>The complete suite of software systems connected to and dependent on the database can become inoperable due to any failure of the database.

These products are application servers, management and development tools, orchestration engines, etc. The SOA integration architecture is quite robust due to the fact that it’s integrated apps are coupled loosely and free to mature organically. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture\">SOA architecture</a> helps to bring costs down as it is easier to tend to stacked apps compared to maintaining each and every constituent application as a standalone. The reliability-factor of stacked apps is also higher than that of separate standalone programs. Once a stacked framework has been implemented, adding additional applications for supporting new business processes is not too expensive. SOA stacking allows businesses to create, consolidate and deploy services and add/modify them as required. It also allows the convenience of the rapid introduction of new services, easy modification of existing ones and compatibility to external systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Disadvantages of the SOA approach:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>The disadvantage of the SOA approach is that multiple products in the stack have to be configured and deployed. Since a stack usually has a large number of products within its framework, this can take time.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>SOA implementation takes a long time, at times years. This extends the initial implementation phase over a considerable period of time and hence drives up the initial implementation cost.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Also, developers working to build the stack framework have to have expertise in each of the proprietary software slated to be included in the stack. So recruitment of new developers will have to be given careful attention as it is mandatory that they have the specialist knowledge that went into creation, deployment, and maintenance of the stack so far.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>At the same time, significant initial investments, complicated configurations, and change management, demanding network and system monitoring make up the dark side of SOA solutions.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>SOA-based integration is of two types: point-to-point integration and enterprise service bus (ESB).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Point-to-point integration with SAP interfaces </strong>is complex, expensive and tedious. It isn\'t flexible as it forms rigid links; and is suited for the SAP environment only. Also, It is less suitable to a SAP environment that is constantly evolving. Business processes of an organization are bound to change constantly due to improvements and adjustments. The point-to-point integration architecture lacks additional touchpoints between the integrated systems and the resulting dependencies are unreliable. This isn’t an ideal long term investment.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This type of integration is beneficial when there are few services or systems to be integrated. It’s when the size and complexity of the business ERP increase that the point-to-point approach tends to become counter-intuitive as explained above.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Enterprise service bus (ESB) </strong>is a fundamental component of the SOA stack. It primarily acts as a messenger between applications and components. It is able to maintain and manage traditional SOA stacks efficiently. ESBs come with their own management tools. They also integrate well with the management tools currently being used in the organization. They do not come laden with a heap of new technologies that have to be learned to work with them. They integrate well with the development tools and technologies already in use. Integration using ESB reduces upfront costs.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The disadvantage of the ESB approach is that like a shared database, there is a high dependency of every integrated software application on it. Any problems with the ESB will freeze up the entire ERP system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Robotic process automation (RPA)</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>AI robots do not need to be programmed but can mimic and learn repetitive user operations on the system frontend GUI. This ability of a robot is not limited to just one application but they can interact with several applications. Implementing RPA doesn’t require major changes to the system or programming. There is no need for APIs as this integration is at a user interface level. It is quick.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Disadvantages:<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>There are limits to AI intuitiveness.

A business runs its Instagram account to reach and grow an audience base and try to convert them into end-users of its products or services. This is more of a facility to prospect for customers, rather than share personal or private non-professional subject matter. Several businesses, however, choose deliberately to run personal accounts, and this is entirely up to the vision and philosophy of the business owners and decision-makers.

Consistency helps to build and maintain brand reputation. Try to use the same profile picture everywhere! This will take some work as you would probably need a lot of time and work to figure out what works with both you and your target audience and what doesn’t. But once you do find “your look,” stick with it. Any Instagrammer will look at the profile photo first, and consciously or unconsciously form impressions.

It makes sense to make use of its mammoth user base for building and promoting your brand. Let us learn how to increase Facebook traffic, to and from your business website. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Rely on yourself instead of algorithms</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is common knowledge that whenever there is a change in the algorithms of the internet dominators (Google, Facebook, Insta, et al), there is a direct effect on one’s brand website traffic. So instead of depending on algorithms that are bound to change it’s better to just market differently on these platforms.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Facebook Messenger, unlike Facebook’s wall or page, allows linking to websites without scrutiny by the algorithm. Like text messaging or sending emails, using Facebook Messenger to increase Facebook traffic to your business website takes some work. The good news is it isn\'t difficult.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The popularity of messaging apps is overtaking social media platforms. According to these <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/facebook-traffic-messenger/\">statistics</a>, users are more inclined to open messenger chats and click through to business website pages using the links inside the chats than through traditional marketing emails. And the best thing about marketing on Facebook Messenger is that you need not focus on selling or conversion. It’s just plain and simple engagement with the user by having a simple and friendly conversation.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>Neil Patel, in his <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/facebook-traffic-messenger/\">blog</a>, has discussed some useful tactics to use Facebook Messenger to increase Facebook traffic to your business website. All the tactics shown below are aimed at increasing the number of contacts on a Messenger List. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Install a Facebook Messenger Chatbot on your business website</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":123} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Increase-Facebook-Traffic-of-Your-Business-Website-By-Doing-This-01.jpg\" alt=\"Increase Facebook Traffic of Your Business Website By Doing This-01\" class=\"wp-image-123\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Incoming website traffic become messenger contacts. Most people are already logged into their Facebook Messengers. Instead of reading lots of text, they like clicking on the Messenger Widget to get their questions answered.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MobileMonkey and WP-Chatbot help you make your own friendly chatbot on your business website in just a few minutes. They are much more appealing and useful to everyone than the traditional contact form on the “Contact Us” page of many websites. It beats having to wait for a response when one can get instant attention in a more friendly and personalized format in the form of an artificially-intelligent machine-learning chatbot.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Add Messenger Contacts from existing Email Subscribers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The rationale behind this tactic is converting existing contacts into more effective marketing channels. This is easily done by using a chatbot builder to create links within emails to invitation links where users can opt in to updates.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The list of places that can host a link is only limited by a marketer’s imagination. Some of them are CTAs in blogs, email signatures, and landing pages.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Turn existing Facebook fans into Messenger contacts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":125} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Increase-Facebook-Traffic-of-Your-Business-Website-By-Doing-This-02.jpg\" alt=\"Increase Facebook Traffic of Your Business Website By Doing This-02\" class=\"wp-image-125\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A brand’s existing Facebook page fans are easily encouraged to increase the level of interaction since they already know and trust the brand. When there is already a Facebook page that obviously took some work to gain a sizeable fan following, it makes sense to turn these fans into Messenger Contacts.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The CTA on the Facebook page can be repurposed from simply asking fans to get more information on the business website. Instead of “Find out more” or “Get Details” the CTA can ask fans to “Send Message,” thereby turning them into Messenger contacts via instant participation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Use Post-Autoresponder Bots</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a powerful tactic to convert commenters on a Facebook post into a Messenger Contact. This is done by getting a chatbot to respond immediately after a user finishes commenting on a post. The replying user gets added to the contact list instantly. So all the hard work that was initially put into making an intelligent and value-adding post to build and maintain an organic fan following doesn’t go to waste.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Getting fans to engage in quizzes and polls and rewarding them with coupon codes in the auto-response is a great way to drive engagement in a ready-made fanbase and convert them into Messenger Contacts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Run a Paid Ad</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":126} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://www.efrog.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Increase-Facebook-Traffic-of-Your-Business-Website-By-Doing-This-3.jpg\" alt=\"Increase Facebook Traffic of Your Business Website By Doing This-03\" class=\"wp-image-126\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is for those who don\'t want to leave any stone unturned in building a large Messenger&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Contact base. Growing organic reach and utilizing them ineffective marketing channels are very good approaches, but working on them takes effort and time. There is a Facebook ad format that allows the user clicking on the ad to send a message to the advertiser. This automatically turns that user into a Messenger Contact.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Normally you’d think of a Facebook ad working hard to justify the money you’ve spent on it by taking users to your brand website. Then, it’s up to the brand website to handle the user and try a successful conversion. There is always the chance of users bouncing due to the lack of interactivity on the business website.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using an autoresponder in conjunction with the Facebook paid ad engages a user and reduces the risk of bounce through instant interaction. The autoresponder ad, something that runs in tandem with a Facebook ad can be built with ease on any good chatbot building platform.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have focussed on the Messenger feature as a marketing channel as it allows more engagement.

Although, there is no major differentiation factor for the cyber criminals to make choice from large scale or small-scale businesses, but small-scale business needs to be more careful for avoiding any kind of security threats as it may cost a lot and can become immensely difficult to overcome it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is widely known that the websites are attacked every now and then.

Furthermore, when it is about advanced authenticity, then the EV SSL certificate plays a vital role in giving the green address bar as a power to the name of the business and on the URL of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Understanding the vitality of <strong>e-commerce website security</strong>, here below are few factors to lay important consideration on -&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>1. Train the Employees-&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Giving extensive training to the employees regarding the importance of data security and conducting important tutorials on data breach prevention is the prerequisite. Also, there should be mock sessions for the protection of sensitive information of the users and further helping the employees’ to grasp the fact and act in accordance to it.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>2. Only Authorized Employees should be Given Access to Business Computers&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It should be ensured that only the team of authorized employees should be provided with access to the computer that has all the records of the customers and transaction records too. The better alternative in this regard is the creation of an account for every employee. This will restrict usage. Also, it’s important to have a track of all information on employee’s tasks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>3. Don’t Make Sensitive User Data Storage -&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Usually, every website makes storage of its user information in the databases. But, ideally, any personal data of the users should not be stored after they are done with the final check-out process. The former user on visiting the website again will come back and shop from the website by entering all the financial details again and checkout as usual. As a result, the changes in identity theft and data breach will be reduced.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>4. Maintenance of Security on Mobile Phones-&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to keep the business confidentiality in control, many companies maintain the limitation of mobile usage inside the business premise, particularly in the zone of cyber security for avoiding data leakage which can further lead to security issues of the website.

This way, a lot of change can be introduced with strong protection measures.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>5. Data Encryption&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is important to encrypt all the information whenever vital data is stored on any device like cloud technology. It is not possible to decrypt the information without the private key. After the information has been encrypted, the only person having a key can decode or decrypt it. Therefore, this way the small businesses have encrypted information. There will be the requirement of a key to activate it and keep the data safe.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>6. Request the Users to Create Strong Passwords&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the major reasons that major cyber-attacks happen is the vulnerability among which weak password is the vital reason. Undoubtedly, hackers are well trained for breaking passwords using ample of techniques. It is important to make sure that the password created is the combination of alpha, numerical as well as symbols. Considerations should be made for including captcha validation for ensuring the right user is accessing the website. And, further to create a stronger password, the use of upper and lower case combinations is advised. However, one of the most advanced techniques is the two-way authentication which helps in resolving the security issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>7. Make Use of Tracking Numbers for Every Order&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every ordered product that is shipped to any specific customer must be tracked using the tracking code and by following the link created on all the rules. This way identification of products from any sort of theft or fraud is made easy to detect. Also, there can be the situation when the customer may deny receiving any order despite receiving its delivery and further may ask for the cash back. A strong tracking system can definitely help in preventing such fraud cases as well. Therefore, there should be the system of delivering the product to the customers with the signature of the customer taken during order handling the parcel and generating the bill at the shipping address.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>8. Track Suspicious Activities with System Alert Setup&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to create the set up for tracking the software, tracking the pattern of user’s behaviour is very essential.

And, when the primary server malfunctions or if anyway been compromised, online backups prove to be excellent solution. Along with this, maintaining offline data backups is also the solution for the maintenance of data copies on the official servers of the company. In addition to this, local backups help in rescuing from any sort of data disaster happening from the host providers.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>10. Authenticate Control on Third-Party Security&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quite often businesses rely on various third-party vendors for credit card transactions, security issues and payrolls. Before looking for any third party for such functionalities, it is better to settle down with those through contract signing that will definitely help in strengthening the security measures and safeguarding the details of the company and data from any sort of cyber attack. Henceforth, they will be stated responsible for all the security measures. Therefore, it is important to opt for third- party security controls only after assuring a proper check on all the security standards.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Final Words -</strong> E-commerce website security is one of the most vital factors of consideration these days for any online business. Even a little negligence can become a big risk to the online business.

So, when posting content, keeping up the interest factor and creating thought-provoking content is important for the audience. Remember that posting boring piece of information or things which the targeted audience of yours wouldn’t be interested in, should be given a miss. Therefore, when the content is appealing to the targeted audience and further leads to engagement, the business may become a possible source for the customers when they might be searching for any relevant answer or content. &nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Discover the Target Audience</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To keep going with all the interest seeking content that will be capturing the interest of the audience, it is important to first be aware as whom you are actually willing to target. There will be actually no point in reaching out to the masses at once. It’s not possible for content to seek everyone’s interest at once and product or services to fit into every demographic. The matter of significance is discovering your target very well and developing an understanding of people who are actually seeking for your content and the factors attracting them. With the right understanding of the targeted audience, you can easily develop the content that perfectly fits their preferences.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Make Branding the Focal Point!</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If people come across your content, give it a read and find it good to share multiple times, you are definitely going the right way of giving a unique and prominent identification to your brand that they can further get associated with your name and over the brilliance of the content. It is the widespread nature of effective content that proves to be the best way of developing brand awareness among potential customers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Originality is a Must!</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Undeniably, copying ideas or mindlessly following competitors in the industry is a bad practice that should be given a skip. However, it is always advisable to keep a constant check on the competitors and their practices of sustaining among the customers and make efforts to stand out. Try to figure out the ways that can reflect your own style and character that doesn’t match with any. It is important to stand out from others and get noticed among the customers. No wonder, with little efforts on maintaining originality, will magnetize a good number of followers seeking those original and fresh content ideas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Maximize Conversion Rate by Targeting Right Keywords</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your company must make efforts to target words that can help the company to rank and also target terms that can often appeal to the customers on the sales page of the website. Also, during the stage of offsite link building, relevant keyword research should be considered a very vital process. All this needs to be considered before the process of content development for the website and even before making the search for the keywords of any specific page. Even summaries on every blog post can also make it much easier for the search engines to pick in order to boost up the website’s importance and appeal than before.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Consistency – the Key Factor!</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Content Marketing is always a long-term commitment of catering to the audience with premium quality content and develop relationships, despite being considered as a campaign. Many companies even consider this as one of the never-ending processes. In fact, for multiple reasons, keeping the consistency in the content development process is stated as the best way of developing good ROI on the process of content marketing.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Boosting the reach and engagement of the content is a time requiring process. Therefore, losing patience and giving up early is just like sowing seeds, making all the efforts but skipping the process of harvest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>A suitable sales funnel is developed with the maintenance of content marketing consistency.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Sustained publishing by a website with qualitative content is rewarded by Google with better ranking.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Time coupled with knowledge is equal to the authority which is required.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>‘Short and Crisp’ Content is Always Better!</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People looking for a good article with advice or tips, always fear or dislike long and stretching paragraphs to reads with ample of words. Thus, for the development of attractive and engaging sentences, the development of the content should be done with the inclusion of bullets, relevant images and with the use of just a few small sentences to give details and move further.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For sure, none of the content is developed with a motto of just getting engagement of the reader for the first few paragraphs or a few minutes and loses the interest of the reader because of the length. These days, people with a busier lifestyle prefer giving quick-read to anything of their desire and get prompt answers to the factors they were looking for. Therefore, keeping the content short and crisp is the preferred mantra.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong><em>The Don’ts -</em></strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Publicizing Company’s Product Line</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No wonder, posting thought-provoking content that enables the customer’s reach to the company’s product pages is one of the most vital factors of consideration but simply posting everything about the product and get into hard selling should be avoided.

Therefore, same effort, resource and time and making should be devoted to the creation of content for both pre- and post-sale experiences.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Bring an End to Make it All About You!</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The procedure of content marketing should not be misunderstood with commercializing your brand. It’s the story that seeks the interest of the existing as well as potential customers. In fact, it is considered to be the solution or an answer to any question.

It is important for both the website and the pages with content on the website should be designed well for both mobile and desktop. Since, the ultimate goal of the content marketing strategy is to invite people on the website, make them read the content and assist them in making the purchase.

From employee training to marketing, every aspect of your business deserves attention.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rapid growth doesn’t happen overnight, but there are several steps you must take to keep your business moving forward. It takes time and effort. However, when you start reaping the benefits, you will see that your effort is worth it. Here are some tips to consider if you wish to see your business grow.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Grow Your Small Business</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Understand Your Customers</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can only develop products and services that will be a huge hit if you are attentive to the needs of your customers and prospects. One way to understand exactly what your customers want is through research and surveys.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should be constantly inviting them to provide honest, even brutal feedback. Reviews and surveys are the best ways to get inside the mind of your customers. This makes it easier for you to develop products and services that are suitable to the current demands of the market. Moreover, it helps you understand the areas in which your company needs to improve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Improve Customer Service</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you don’t provide quality customer service, it will be difficult to satisfy your customers even if you have a superior product or service. This aspect of the business is about taking the extra step to make them feel special.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let your customers know that they are valued. If they have problems, make sure you address them right away. If they have questions, take time to answer them. They should not feel like things are difficult for them if they raise certain issues. Social media is a great way to understand your customers by listening to them. If they find the customer service satisfactory, they might even recommend others to also buy from your business.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Establish Loyalty</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It takes time to encourage customers to come and buy what you have to offer. But it’s not enough to just get them to buy. You need to encourage loyalty. Considering that there are other competitors who could offer them better, you want them to remain loyal to you. Don’t feel complacent just because you already have a lot of loyal customers. They can be easily attracted to other options and they might leave you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Provide loyalty rewards. If there are discounts and promotions, let these most loyal customers be the first ones to know. You must sure your customers know they are appreciated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Maximize Social Media</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Without a doubt, social media is a very powerful tool. It reaches out to hundreds upon thousands of people at once. Make sure your business is engaged in social media. This helps you stay relevant. Listening to people and reading their comments will give you an idea on how to make them feel more satisfied. You will also understand their behaviour and find a way to meet their demands. The best part is that you won’t have to spend a lot of money just to attract new customers. You don’t need to engage in comment wars though. Just keep it positive and make everyone feel that they are heard.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Focus on Professional Development</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The success of your business also depends on the quality of employees that you hire. Building an effective team is the key to ensuring that your business prospers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the best ways to have motivated employees who work hard is to give them a sense of purpose. They should not just feel like they have to work for the sake of working.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They want to belong to something bigger than themselves. They must understand the bigger goals. This is where branding comes in. Many mistakenly believe that branding is something you do to attract customers. However, a powerful brand will also help you draw quality workers to your business.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your employees should also feel that they are heard. There are team-building activities that could help them perform well as individual employees and through collaborative tasks. You should also send them to training sessions and seminars so that they can improve on the current bank of knowledge that they already have.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Find Out What Works</strong></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, you will know which of the approaches you’ve used worked well. Take note of these tactics and use them again. Those strategies that failed must be eliminated to help your business move forward. The goal is to remain relevant. Refine the approach and focus more on those that bring satisfactory results.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the end, you will see your business improve. You just have to be patient. You also need to work really hard and not let obstacles prevent you from doing better. Soon, you will see the positive results you have always hoped for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', '5 Things You Must Do to Grow Your Small Business Fast in 2020', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '251-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-04-15 03:34:27', '2020-04-15 03:34:27', '', 251, 'https://www.efrog.com.au/blog/2020/04/15/251-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
